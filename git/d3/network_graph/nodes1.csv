[Ala.] jail, there are far too many illegal aliens there because they have victimized Americans.â€ùThe freshman congressman defined the limits on how far he would take his efforts.â€œAs your congressman on the House floor, Iâ€™ll do anything short of shooting them, anything that is lawful,â€ù Brooks said. â€œIt needs to be done because illegal aliens need to quit taking jobs from American citizens.â€ùRecently, the Alabama legislature passed what is considered to be the toughest immigration law in the nation.",GOP congressman on stopping illegal immigration: â€˜Iâ€™ll do anything short of shooting themâ€™,http://dailycaller.com/2011/06/29/gop-congressman-on-stopping-illegal-immigration-ill-do-anything-short-of-shooting-them/,http://dailycaller.com/2011/06/29/gop-congressman-on-stopping-illegal-immigration-ill-do-anything-short-of-shooting-them/2017-01-05T04:31:00.804216,-12.59%,34%,"Some liberals and Democrats have gone so far as to give illegal aliens preference over American citizens.Whenever Iâ€™ve stated that illegal aliens are stealing jobs from American citizens, I usually hear from liberals, Democrats and bleeding-heart do-gooders, all of whom tell me that illegals only take jobs that American citizens wonâ€™t take.By granting the coveted slot to the illegal, Stanford had to turn away a number of qualified American citizens who had applied for the same position.A few weeks later, the same restaurants were open for business because they hired American citizens who needed jobs.Some restaurants have been raided by Border Patrol and had the majority of their kitchen and cleaning staff arrested for being illegal aliens.","Whenever Iâ€™ve stated that illegal aliens are stealing jobs from American citizens, I usually hear from liberals, Democrats and bleeding-heart do-gooders, all of whom tell me that illegals only take jobs that American citizens wonâ€™t take. I know for a fact that is not true.I personally know men who worked in the construction industry. They worked hard in all kinds of weather so they could provide for their families. Some of those same men ended up unemployed because contractors and builders were hiring illegal aliens for less money, often paying them cash without reporting it or paying taxes. I dare any of those who have argued against me to stand face-to-face with any of these men and tell them that illegal aliens only take jobs Americans wonâ€™t take.Iâ€™ve seen the same thing happen in restaurants. Some restaurants have been raided by Border Patrol and had the majority of their kitchen and cleaning staff arrested for being illegal aliens. A few weeks later, the same restaurants were open for business because they hired American citizens who needed jobs.Some liberals and Democrats have gone so far as to give illegal aliens preference over American citizens.In 2014, The Denver Public School District just hired their first illegal alien to teach at their Denver Center for International Studies as Ford Elementary School. Alejandro Fuentes Mena is now a fifth-grade teacher at the school and he is not a US citizen nor does he have any legal paperwork that allows him to stay and work in the US. He says that his parents came to the US illegally from Chile when he was four years old.Their goal is to be the first school district in the nation to actively recruit teachers who were brought to the United States illegally and are given the status as â€˜deferred action for childhood arrivals by the Obama administration.Why are they so actively recruiting illegals to be teachers?Tom Boasberg, Superintendent of the Denver Public School District says that â€˜undocumented immigrantsâ€™ make up 10%-20% of the student population.In 2014, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obamaâ€™s former White House Chief of Staff, announced that he was opening up the cityâ€™s 23,000 jobs and internships to illegal aliens.The official news release reads in part:â€œMayor Rahm Emanuel announced today that the City is, for the first time, opening up nearly 23,000 City-funded internship, volunteer, and job opportunities for undocumented students, or â€˜DREAMers.â€™â€ùSome prestigious colleges and universities have been admitting illegal aliens for positions that would otherwise go to American citizens. In one case, Stanford admitted a former homeless illegal alien by giving him a coveted elite student slot. Along with the admission, the illegal received financial aid along with grant and scholarship money. By granting the coveted slot to the illegal, Stanford had to turn away a number of qualified American citizens who had applied for the same position.Continue Reading",Illegal Aliens Getting Preference over American Citizens  Liberty Alliance,http://libertyalliance.com/illegal-aliens-getting-preference-american-citizens/,http://libertyalliance.com/illegal-aliens-getting-preference-american-citizens/2017-02-17T15:08:19.767918,-12.50%,30%,"According to her, she was forced out of the Immigration Department while Candelaria Saldivar served as the CEO.She also told the committee that there was poor support for the department from the Ministry.According to Castellanos, she was â€œâ€_in the belly of the beast.â€ùShe told the committee that there was a culture of corruption among immigration officers who worked together like a, â€œfraternityâ€ù.She revealed that she and former Director, Maria Marin, tried to set things straight but the officers disregarded their instructions.","According to Castellanos, she was â€œâ€_in the belly of the beast.â€ùShe told the committee that there was a culture of corruption among immigration officers who worked together like a, â€œfraternityâ€ù.She revealed that she and former Director, Maria Marin, tried to set things straight but the officers disregarded their instructions.She also told the committee that there was poor support for the department from the Ministry.According to her, she was forced out of the Immigration Department while Candelaria Saldivar served as the CEO.",Immigration Department,https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/02/15/immigration-department-belly-beast/,https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/02/15/immigration-department-belly-beast/2017-02-13T09:38:12.232144,-12.50%,44%,"I asked them what they were doing and one of the men replied, â€˜what is it to with me?â€™.Welcome Mohapi, said he had asked the men, who were using a company vehicle to dump rubbish, what they were doing.A BRIARDENE Informal Settlement resident was assaulted after attempting to stop men from illegally dumping at the settlement on Wednesday afternoon.He believe the household refuse was destined for the dump but the men decided to use the settlement instead.I replied saying I live here, I began taking down their registration number of the vehicle and they said I could do what I want.","A BRIARDENE Informal Settlement resident was assaulted after attempting to stop men from illegally dumping at the settlement on Wednesday afternoon.

An ICE official said the agency was not able to confirm the percentage or number of immigrants in the country illegally with criminal convictions.Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies, said her research shows the majority of the criminal immigrants are here illegally and backed up Trumpâ€™s statement. Trump cited her research during his campaign.â€œBased on my review of various sets of data and records from ICE that includes the exact immigration status of sets of ICE removal cases, I am confident in saying that most of this population of criminal aliens is here illegally,â€ù Vaughan said of the 1.9 million in the federal report. â€œUnder the law, criminal aliens who at one time had legal status generally would become disqualified for that legal status upon conviction of certain crimes.â€ùAdam Cox, an expert on immigration law and professor at New York University, said a criminal conviction itself does not alter the immigration status of a lawful immigrant, such as a green card holder.â€œThese immigrants are not stripped of their status the moment they are convicted,â€ù Cox said.If a convicted green card holder is placed in deportation proceedings, he or she would lose the green card only at the end of immigration proceedings if an immigration judge rules that the criminal conviction makes the person deportable, Cox said.Trumpâ€™s claim that â€œit could be even 3 millionâ€ù criminal immigrants in the country illegally also surpasses calculations from a group estimating it could be less than 1 million.The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank analyzing the movement of people and policies that affect them, in July 2015 estimated that 43 percent, or 820,000, of the 1.9 million noncitizens convicted of crimes were unauthorized immigrants. The institute analyzed estimates of the unauthorized population and the number of noncitizens lawfully in the country and estimated that both groups commit crimes at similar rates.The precise number of unauthorized immigrants convicted of crimes may be higher or lower, with a margin of error in the low tens of thousands, the institute said.Trumpâ€™s plan to deport 2 million to 3 million parallels the number of total immigrants deported under President Barack Obama. More than 2 million people have been deported over the course of Obamaâ€™s presidency.Our rulingTrump said there are â€œprobably 2 million, it could be even 3 millionâ€ù criminal immigrants in the country illegally.Trumpâ€™s slightly hedged numbers stem from a federal report that said there are about 1.9 million â€œremovable criminal aliens,â€ù but that includes people here legally and illegally.

Criminal illegal aliens and those who do not have the proper paperwork are being taken into custody and put in the pipeline for deportation. The media and the left are besides themselves in their outrage over this. They are continually using the fact that many have families here and making it sound cruel and heartless. If it were up to me, their families would be deported with each of them. That would be the â€˜kindâ€™ thing to do. New York over the last few days has seen ICE detain a number of illegal aliens.New York City is not alone in their â€˜personal touchâ€™ from ICE. Over 160 illegal aliens were just rounded up in Los Angeles. 150 of those are criminal illegal aliens. Phoenix deported a mother, who is now 36, that has lived here in the US since she was 14. Her husband is an illegal alien and she has two anchor babies. She was convicted of identity theft and ICE detained her when she checked in. She was taken back to Mexico this weekend. Again, her husband and children should have been sent with her. This is just the beginning as President Trump begins the long, arduous process of deporting millions of illegal aliens and building a wall on our southern border with Mexico. They now say the wall will take three years and cost over $21 billion dollars. President Trump claims he can bring that cost way down.From the Observer:Make the Road New York, an immigrant advocacy group, told the media this evening that Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps on Staten Island netted five Mexican nationals in the past week and a halfâ€”coinciding with similar actions across the nation. The raids took place on February 2, February 3, February 5 and February 8, according to speakers on the press call. All five individuals taken by ICE officers were male, and four of them have children who are U.S. citizens, the group reported. Make the Road believes several of the men are now in New Jersey detention centers. â€œWhat weâ€™ve seen is that the incidents in Staten Island are consistent with what weâ€™ve seen with the surge of ICE activity in the last week,â€ù Theo Oshiro, deputy director of Make the Road New York said. Immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least six states in raids this past week, pursuant to an executive order Trump signed last month. That fiat expanded the category of immigrants lacking proper paperwork that federal authorities would target for arrest and expulsion. Rather than focusing, as President Barack Obama did, on individuals with violent criminal convictions, ICE now has a mandate to nab undocumented immigrants if they have ever been accused of any crime, even â€œwhere such charge has not been resolved.â€ùI have no sympathy for these people. All by definition are criminals since they did not come here legally. Most have had years to start the process of becoming citizens and havenâ€™t bothered to do so. If we are not a nation of laws, we are nothing. Trump is now getting ready to cut off federal funding to sanctuary campuses, cities and states. A number of states are now cutting off state funding of sanctuary campuses and cities who are defying the rule of law. This is going to get intense, but it must be done if America is to survive.Just listen to the bleeding heart media here â€“ it just makes your blood boil:Carlos Vargas, a member of Make the Road New Yorkâ€™s legal services team, said that in one case, two plainclothes officers approached a â€œhardworkingâ€ù father at 5:30 a.m., showed him a few pictures of people for whom they were looking and subsequently arrested and detained him. In another case, ICE agents showed a family more than 10 pictures of people for whom they were looking and left when they did not identify the individual. They subsequently came back 20 minutes later and detained one of them.Oh, put a sock in it already. ICE is not targeting families. They are doing their job. If you are an illegal alien, I would suggest you get legal or self-deport. Trump said that he would deport or incarcerate up to three million undocumented immigrants who he says are â€œcriminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers,â€ù stating that the country has â€œa lot of these people.â€ù We do. Experts estimate his executive order could impact as many as eight million people, more than two-thirds of foreign nationals who entered or who have remained in the United States without authorization. Good. In fact, I hope it impacts a hell of a lot more than that.

However, no arrests were made even after the game warden identified individuals in the hunting party.â€œInstead, the police and I were soon forced to run for cover as the hunting party, which included my nephew, opened fire on us,â€ù said the game warden.He said the hunters were either strong people or were backed by influentials in the area.Similarly, in late November 2013, another leopard was smoked out of its cave and then clubbed and axed to death. These leopards were killed in the Punch and Kotli districts of AJK.According to the wildlife department, there have never been cases of common leopards attacking or killing people.â€œThere have been minor incidents only for which people are to be blamed. Last year, a man saw a leopard in the bush and hit it with a stick. In defence, the big cat scratched the manâ€™s face,â€ù the game warden said.He added that a similar case was reported when a woman tried to hit a leopard to scare it away. â€œThe leopard scratched the woman and took off.â€ùDr Anis Rehman of the Himalayan Wildlife Foundation, a local NGO working on conservation efforts of indigenous species in AJK, said none of the leopards had come into conflict with local residents.â€œWe are losing this important species as we deliberate over phone calls and exchange emails on what is being done. It does not seem to bother the government which is not taking immediate actions to save the common leopard,â€ù he said.Dr Anis believed more resources needed to be injected into the wildlife department to save the common leopard from completely vanishing from the forests of Pakistan.While AJK wildlife department said influentials were hunting leopards for fun, conservation organisations attribute the increase in illegal hunting to conflict between people and the animal.â€œThe figures may not be accurate but the trend is very disturbing. We have taken notice of the issue,â€ù said Director Biodiversity World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Uzma Khan who has been supporting and educating local communities scattered in the hills of AJK to be more tolerant towards the big cat in Punch and Kotli districts.WWF has been educating locals to improve on grazing techniques while discouraging the free grazing system where domestic animals are allowed to wander off.She emphasised that hunting of the common leopard was prohibited because it was a protected species.â€œBecause there is no punishment, those with resources will exploit the system. It is also wrong that the media portrays these exotic cats as bloodthirsty beasts,â€ù she said.Providing an example, she said last week the media described a leopard captured in Sialkot as a beast which resulted in a negative image of the animal and decreased its chances of survival.Uzma Khan lamented that there were no concrete measures or conservations efforts by the government to protect the common leopard from vanishing completely.However, the exact number of the common leopard in the wild, starting from where Punch River enters at the Pakistan-India border all the way down to the Margalla Hills, has never been known.Uzma Khan explained that leopards covered significant territory. â€œWe collared a leopard in Ayubia National Park last year which covered four to five kilometres in a single day.A leopard spotted in a particular area can also be spotted in a far off distance the same day, making it difficult to count their exact number,â€ù she explained.Dr Ali Nawaz, a professor in Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad and founder of the Snow Leopard Conservation Trust, echoed along similar lines while giving the example of a snow leopard that was collared.The leopard spent summers in Afghanistan and the winters in Chitral, he said.Dr Nawaz has recently concluded a research on the common leopard in Ayubia National Park stretching into the forest of Nathia Gali, Dunga Gali and Khanspur. Dr Ali Nawaz tested 100 samples of feces collected in the park and the results were also published in the International Scientific Journal earlier this month.â€œWe found that livestock made up more than 80 per cent of the leopardâ€™s diet. This is not surprising as the animalâ€™s natural prey has almost vanished due to expanding settlements and loss of habitat.Domesticated animals are easier to hunt,â€ù Dr Ali Nawaz told Dawn while explaining that conflict between leopards and man was becoming inevitable.He did not blame the AJK wildlife department which he believed lacked the resources and capacity to protect the common leopard from illegal hunting.",Illegal hunting â€“ leopards now threatened species,http://www.dawn.com/news/1082971,http://www.dawn.com/news/10829712017-02-21T14:16:28.025362,-5.55%,28%,"Federal Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the operation was a blow against businesses which flouted the law and employed illegal foreign workers.Officers sent 21 to Brisbane to be deported or apply for bridging visas, while two were granted bridging visas and the final four will face more interviews.Australian Border Force officers have caught 27 foreign nationals working illegally at a strawberry farm west of Brisbane.The raid came after police pulled over a car carrying four of the farmâ€™s workers last month.Information gathered in the raids has been passed on the the multi-agency Taskforce Cadena, which was set up to disrupt organisations which arrange for large numbers of foreign workers to work in Australia illegally.","Australian Border Force officers have caught 27 foreign nationals working illegally at a strawberry farm west of Brisbane.ABF and Queensland Police officers raided the property near Stanthorpe early last Tuesday.

But the Border Patrol has been noticing cases of migrants crossing alone but in cell contact with guides, said Mario Escalante, a spokesman for the Tucson office of the Border Patrol.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMobile phones are ubiquitous in Mexico; many migrants consider them essential when crossing, right up there with sturdy shoes and jugs of water.Now, though, in addition to using cellphones to keep relatives up to date on their progress, some illegal immigrants rely on them to keep out of the reach of the authorities. Ms. Silva said that her group had no coyote with them but had received directions by text.The messages typically come during a migrantâ€™s first hour or so of hiking north, those who used the new system said. If they make it that far, the illegal immigrants then meet up with guides on the United States side, who help them trek further north to awaiting vehicles.PhotoAiding the process are numerous spotters, who monitor the southern Arizona desert from lookout points and help steer the migrants, as well as drug shipments, away from the authorities.Smugglers are constantly innovating to elude the authorities, veteran Border Patrol agents say. â€œThey always come up with new, clever ways of trying to avoid us,â€ù said T.

For example, Obama is asking for an 18% increase in the amount of money that is set aside for former presidents. In 2017, when he is a former president, Obama will be benefiting from such an action, and so essentially asked that more money be set aside for himself. In addition to his well deserved pay raise, the president is also asking for an increase in tax payer money that is given to illegal immigrants.The Obama budget plan is asking for another $1.32 billion dollars to aid the unaccompanied children (UAC) who are found crossing the southern border illegally. The Center for Immigration Studies reports that there will be an estimated 75,000 new UACs over the course of next year, and so that this increase in budget would mean an average of $17,613 for each UAC.Keep in mind that the average social security recipient receives an average of $14,772 per yer, indicating that the Obama administration is ensuring that illegal immigrants, who have contributed nothing into the system, receive more money than legal residents of the United States who have been paying taxes their entire lives.To make this even more unbelievable, the administration is planning on expanding their Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program.Illegal immigrants will collect Social Security benefits beginning in 2017.

Itâ€™s pretty simple.In 2014, when the crisis at the border occurred, where tens of thousands of unaccompanied children showed up, the Obama administration decided, â€˜Wow- things must be pretty bad in Central America.â€™Instead of realizing that it was his lax illegal immigration enforcement policies that have caused the surge of illegal immigration over his presidency, Obama decided that he had to do something about those who are living in poverty to the south of the U.S.He enacted the CAM Refugee Program to go into countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador to screen children, and fly them out of their countries and relocated them in America as refugees, fleeing their countries.Most of those who have been flown out of the Central American countries are between 16 and 17 years old, and just like the Syrian refugees, are predominantly male.They were then allowed to reunite with relatives of the United States who were residing within the country legally.In other words, tax payers are paying for the Obama administration to actively bring in more illegal immigrants by flying them over the border, and claiming that they are fleeing their countries out of fear of persecution.Source","Obama Asks Congress For 1.3 Billion To â€œResettleâ€ù Illegal Immigrants ($17,613 per Illegal Immigrant.",http://puntlandnews.net/2016/12/21/obama-asks-congress-for-1-3-billion-to-resettle-illegal-immigrants-17613-per-illegal-immigrant/,http://puntlandnews.net/2016/12/21/obama-asks-congress-for-1-3-billion-to-resettle-illegal-immigrants-17613-per-illegal-immigrant/2017-02-14T15:26:55.214335,-3.47%,42%,"Immigration Raids Yield Over 600, Creating Fear In Illegal AliensWhat, exactly, is making illegal aliens fearful?Of the 160 illegal immigrants arrested during the Trump raids, the vast majority had felony convictions and merited deportation.President Trump proclaimed on Twitter early Sunday morning: â€œThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise.It remained unclear whether the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were part of continuing operations to round up illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or a ramping-up of deportations by the Trump administration.So, if most illegal aliens are just â€œgood people,â€ù why be concerned?","Immigration Raids Yield Over 600, Creating Fear In Illegal AliensWhat, exactly, is making illegal aliens fearful? The majority of people caught up in the sweeps were targeted because they are felons. People who have done very wrong. People who should have been deported the minute they were let out of jail. So, if most illegal aliens are just â€œgood people,â€ù why be concerned?(NY Times) Federal immigration officials arrested more than 600 people across at least 11 states last week, detaining 40 people in the New York City area, law enforcement officials said on Sunday. It remained unclear whether the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were part of continuing operations to round up illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or a ramping-up of deportations by the Trump administration. President Trump proclaimed on Twitter early Sunday morning: â€œThe crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!â€ù But Gillian Christensen, acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said, â€œThe focus of these targeted enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICEâ€™s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis.â€ù The contradiction heightened an already swelling fear among immigrants and their advocates.Notice that the initial focus of the article is on Trump, not the good news that hundreds of people unlawfully present in the United States with criminal records were rounded up. And, if wasnâ€™t for a few small quotes, there wouldnâ€™t even be a mention of most of the people being criminals, with crimes like rape and assault, and worse.And this is making people who are unlawfully present in the US fearful(Chicago Tribune) Pastor Fred Morris looked out over his congregation Sunday as news ricocheted around the world that American authorities were rounding up immigrants in an enforcement surge that President Donald Trump promised on the campaign trail. Parishioners did not smile as on any other Sunday morning. They stared down at their feet. Others didnâ€™t attend at all. â€œThere is a dreadful sense of fear. Itâ€™s more than palpable. Itâ€™s radiating. People are terrified,â€ù said Morris, whose United Methodist mission is in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood of Los Angeles. â€œThey were just sitting there in stunned silence.â€ù For days, fear and confusion have gripped immigrant communities after word spread that federal agents were rounding up hundreds of immigrants in cities across the country. The scope of the operation remained unclear on Sunday.And well they should be, if they are, even at a minimum, here in the U.S. illegally. This meme is repeated in article after article after article. And it is causing liberals to howl. Even though the vast majority are, again, serious criminals, liberals have found it in themselves to support them. Why? Ask them. They wonâ€™t answer.But, hey, CNNâ€™s Joey Jackson says we need a new reality checkBut while these raids are not new in and of themselves, advocates and others watching these raids unfold are right to worry whether this President is casting a wider net and expanding the objective in ICE enforcement beyond national security. Of the 160 illegal immigrants arrested during the Trump raids, the vast majority had felony convictions and merited deportation. To be sure, the federal government has a solemn obligation to secure the borders and to protect the public. But there are questions as to the other arrests. The concern from a justice perspective, then, is not the enforcement effort itself. The executive branch enforces the law, and any President is entitled to do so in the manner he deems most effective in keeping with his philosophy. Instead, the concern lies in whether enforcement will be over broad and unduly aggressive.Itâ€™s all right there: an obligation to secure the borders and protect the public. There is no â€œbutâ€ù. There is no â€œunduly aggressiveâ€ù when it comes to arresting and deporting those who are unlawfully present. Unduly aggressive is giving a ticket to kids running a lemonade stand and requiring them to get a permit, or shutting them down. Unduly aggressive is suspending a child who bit a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun. If youâ€™re concerned with arresting criminals, perhaps you should reevaluate your personal philosophy.Itâ€™s one thing to be tough on immigration. Itâ€™s yet another to be fair. Those watching closely are right to be worried about current trends, but should take comfort in knowing that immigration courts will serve as a check upon any overreach by ICE in conducting these raids and carrying out the Presidentâ€™s enforcement initiatives. But we should really reality-check ourselves, too, and ask whether a country like the United States, which sets the standard for the world in human rights, canâ€™t provide a better example to the world.Why donâ€™t we ask the citizens who had their lives ruined due to identity theft from illegals. Who have seen their wages stagnate partly due to illegal aliens? Who have been harmed by illegals? Who have seen emergency rooms shut because illegals use them too much? Who drain resources away from citizens? What of the human rights of those who are citizens? Should they not come first?Crossed at Pirateâ€™s Cove.

This was in U.S. v. Texas, the lawsuit filed by 26 states to stop the â€œDeferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residentsâ€ù program announced by Obama in November 2014. This case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the injunction. The justices split four-to-four on the case, leaving the injunction in place and the presidentâ€™s plan dead for the rest of his term.In footnote two of his Feb. 16 order, Hanen says this:â€œThe Court uses the phrases â€˜illegal immigrantâ€™ and â€˜illegal alienâ€™ interchangeablyâ€_The Court also understands that there is a certain segment of the population that finds the phrase â€˜illegal alienâ€™ offensive. The Court uses this term because it is the term used by the Supreme Court in its latest pronouncement pertaining to this area of the law. See Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492 (2012).â€ùArizona v.

(File)According to Haaretz, settlement building organization Amana obtained a $1.05 million loan in 2002 to build in the outposts of Amona and Migron by mortgaging private Palestinian lands to which it falsely claimed rights, and upon which it built the outposts.Both Migron and Amona have since been evacuated upon orders by the Israeli Supreme Court, with residents from the latter outpost putting up serious resistance during its dismantlement earlier this month.While the loan was officially obtained through Bank Tefahot, Haaretz said that the banking institution served a â€œmerely the conduitâ€ù for funds supplied by the Israeli government for this loan.Haaretz added that despite claims by Tefahot, Amana still owed nearly 90,000 shekels ($23,985) for construction in Amona, and more than 24,600 shekels ($6,555) for Migron construction.The revelations come shortly after the passage of the â€œRegularization law,â€ù which will grant official Israeli governmental recognition to more than a dozen illegal settlement outposts in the occupied West Bank established on private Palestinian lands.While neither Amona nor Migron were included in the new legislation, the â€œRegularization lawâ€ù states that any settlements built in the occupied West Bank â€œin good faithâ€ù â€” without knowledge that the land upon which it was built was privately owned by Palestinians â€” could be officially recognized by Israel pending minimal proof of governmental support in its establishment and some form of compensation to the Palestinian landowners.As it stands, the law would affect the status of 16 outposts, although Israeli media reports indicated that more could be included in the future.It remains unclear whether the allocation of loans through banking proxies, such as was the case with the two outposts, could constitute such proof of governmental support should it have occurred in other instances.Israeli Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit has repeatedly stated that the bill contravenes both Israeli and international law and that the Israeli Supreme Court would likely strike it down.Several Palestinian municipalities have already petitioned the Supreme Court to dismantle the law.While settler outposts constructed in occupied Palestinian territory were considered illegal by the Israeli government, each of the some 196 government-approved Israeli settlements scattered across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have also been established in direct violation of international law.Via Maâ€™an News Agency",Israeli Gov't Secretly funding illegal squatter Settlements in Palestine,http://www.juancole.com/2017/02/secretly-settlements-palestine.html,http://www.juancole.com/2017/02/secretly-settlements-palestine.html2017-02-13T08:02:57.687960,-3.06%,40%,"The idea that these operations will become the new normal is exactly what undocumented immigrants are afraid of.During the five-day operation, ICE agents detained 160 people, all but 10 with â€œcriminal histories,â€ù according to a statement.Undocumented immigrants await deportation by Border Patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border on April 13, 2016 in Hidalgo, Texas.â€œI was like, â€˜Babe, donâ€™t hang up, Iâ€™ll be there right away,â€™â€ù Velazquez told The Huffington Post.â€œI just want him out of jail and just home already,â€ù Velazquez told HuffPost.","ADVERTISEMENTAUSTIN, Texas â€• President Donald Trumpâ€™s promised crackdown on undocumented immigrants is in full force this week, with increased deportation efforts around the country, activists and elected officials said Friday.Immigrant rights advocates reported an uptick in Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests â€• including the detention of people who were considered low priority for removal until Trump signed an order last month making nearly every undocumented immigrant an important target for deportation.ICE officials initially said that this weekâ€™s actions were â€œroutineâ€ù and nothing outside the ordinary. But in a conference call with reporters Friday evening, an ICE official appeared to contradict that statement, saying that the agencies targeted several cities in an â€œenforcement surge.â€ùRep.

Still, his hard-line approach to the issue contributed to his being voted out of office in November.In an interview, Mr. Arpaio declined to say whether he had advised the president-elect on his border and immigration policies, but said, â€œThereâ€™s a way to stop the problem, but you have to have the will of the president.â€ù He added, â€œIâ€™m optimistic.â€ù","Raids of Illegal Immigrants Bring Harsh Memories, and Strong Fears",http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/illegal-immigrants-raids-deportation.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss,http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/illegal-immigrants-raids-deportation.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss2017-02-17T14:51:35.707409,-2.81%,25%,"But in Jackson County, the court says only commissioners offered a prayer, not audience members, and the prayer was always Christian, not from other faiths.In a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the court ruled in favor of a Jackson County resident who was offended after he began attending county commissioner meetings in 2013 to discuss environmental issues.DETROIT (AP) - A Michigan county's practice of Christian-only prayers at public meetings has been declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.The appeals court says prayer at public meetings can be legal.At one meeting, a commissioner turned his chair around when Bormuth complained about prayer.","DETROIT (AP) - A Michigan county's practice of Christian-only prayers at public meetings has been declared unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.In a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the court ruled in favor of a Jackson County resident who was offended after he began attending county commissioner meetings in 2013 to discuss environmental issues.Peter Bormuth said he felt compelled to stand and participate in religion in order to speak to public officials.

The administration claims that some even had criminal convictions. But in a disturbing development that reveals a profound misunderstanding of immigration law, a DHS official also said that the mere act of being the country without documents was enough to characterize someone as a â€œcriminal alien.â€ù Wrong, it isnâ€™t. Immigration statutes are based in civil lawâ€œWaitress, may I please have a double order of baloney?â€ùApparently, the messy and heartbreaking business of deportations â€” with all those divided families, public protests and crying children â€” is where â€œHope and Changeâ€ù intersects with â€œMake America Great Again.â€ùLefties got offended and pushed back against that comparison. But the facts were not on their side.CNN aired what must have been a parody where Univisionâ€™s Jorge Ramos â€” a partisan Democrat impersonating a journalist â€” told Anderson Cooper that Trump changed the rules. According to Ramos, Obama only deported those who were â€œconvicted of crimes.â€ùThatâ€™s loco. Ramos â€” whose daughter worked for Hillary Clintonâ€™s campaign â€” needs to get out of Miami and go to the front line of Americaâ€™s immigration debate: the Southwest. When he gets to San Diego, Iâ€™ll pick him up at the airport, buy him tacos and introduce him to the retired police lieutenant in a suburban city who told me that his squad room had a special desk for Obamaâ€™s immigration agents. Suspects would be brought in for other crimes and, if they couldnâ€™t prove legal status, they would be scooped up by the feds. And shipped out. No paperwork, no mug shot, no nada.Jorge, this was Obamaâ€™s America. Get it straight. Otherwise, youâ€™re only creating more fog.So letâ€™s clear some away. When you hear about these immigration raids and how immigrants feel terrorized, even if theyâ€™re here legally, remember three things.We donâ€™t know and we may never know if these were raids or targeted apprehensions as the administration claims, and whether they were the result of Trump pulling some trigger. David Marin, director for enforcement and removal operations in the Los Angeles field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told The Associated Press that the agency carries out such operations every few months. Marin said the California operation was planned â€œbefore the administration came out with their current executive orders.â€ùThe United States has the right to protect its borders, enforce the law and deport the undocumented. For crying out loud, this is what Border Patrol agents â€” about half of whom are Latino â€” do for a living! Many of the undocumented are good people who make a big contribution. Still, some have become way too comfortable living somewhere they shouldnâ€™t be. They canâ€™t be surprised about whatâ€™s happening.That said, as former ICE Director John Morton once told me, we canâ€™t deport our way out of our immigration woes. Just because we have the right to remove the undocumented doesnâ€™t mean we should always exercise that right. Mass deportations make lousy public policy. Our immigration problem has many components: a porous border, labor shortages in industries such as farming, lazy teenagers who wonâ€™t do the jobs grandpa did, 11 million undocumented people, the fact that American employers are addicted to illegal labor, etc. Enforcement, however justified, isnâ€™t the cure-all.Beware of the spin.

Advocates cited what they call heavy-handed raids in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, Texas and North Carolina and elsewhere.Yet officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency conducting the raids, say the efforts are business as usual Â— no different than what happened on a regular basis during the Obama years.So which is it? The truth lies somewhere in between. Here are some of the facts surrounding what's happening with immigration enforcement:TRUMP VS. OBAMAAdvertisementAs a candidate, Donald Trump vowed to take a hard line on immigration. Five days after taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that made clear that just about any immigrant living in the country illegally could be a priority for deportation, particularly those with outstanding deportation orders. The president's order also said enforcement priorities would include convicted criminals, immigrants who had been arrested for any criminal offense, those who committed fraud and anyone who may have committed a crime, including immigration violations.Under President Barack Obama, the government focused on immigrants in the country illegally who posed a threat to national security or public safety and recent border crossers. But despite the narrower focus, more than 2 million people were deported during Obama's time in office, including a record of more than 409,000 people in 2012. At one point, his critics dubbed him the ""deporter in chief.""The record was reached with the help of the Secure Communities program that helped the government identify immigrants in the United States illegally who had been arrested. In the latter half of Obama's tenure the Secure Communities program fell out of favor with the administration and local jurisdictions, and deportations plummeted to lows matching those during former President George W. Bush's term.___ARE THE LATEST RAIDS A DIRECT RESULT OF TRUMP'S ORDER?Immigration officials said they weren't. But Trump, during a press conference Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, bragged that his administration was following through on his campaign pledge and targeting ""the bad ones."" He said immigration authorities focused on immigrants in the country illegally ""with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems and we are getting them out.""""I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones, the really bad ones, we are going to get them out,"" Trump said.David Marin, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, said the agency carries out these operations two or three times a year in his region. The California operation was in the planning stages ""before the administration came out with their current executive orders,"" he said.But immigrant rights groups say the actions are harsher than in the past.Advocates began fielding calls Thursday from immigrants and their lawyers reporting raids at homes and businesses in the greater Los Angeles area. In one instance, agents showed up at the home of a 50-year-old house painter named Manuel Mosqueda in the Los Angeles suburbs, looking to arrest an immigrant who wasn't there. In the process, they spoke with Mosqueda, arrested him and put him on a bus to Mexico Â— though lawyers were able to halt his deportation and bring him back.In all, Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested 680 immigrants. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said everyone arrested posed ""a threat to public safety, border security or the integrity of our nation's immigration system.""Kelly said about 75 percent of the people arrested were criminals convicted of a variety of crimes, including ""homicide, aggravated sexual abuse, sexual assault of a minor, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, indecent liberties with a minor, drug trafficking, battery, assault, DUI and weapons charges.""ICE had previously called the arrests an ""enforcement surge"" that was no different than enforcement actions carried out in the past and said a ""rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible."" In a statement, the agency said ""officers frequently encounter additional suspects who may be in the United States in violation of the federal immigration laws. Those persons will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and, when appropriate, arrested by ICE.""___THE NEW NORMAL?Despite the claims that this is business as usual, an indication of the changed tactics came earlier in the week when Kelly testified before Congress. He told lawmakers that immigration agents expressed frustration at not being fully allowed to enforce immigration laws under the Obama administration. He predicted Trump's directives would end that frustration.""I think their morale has suffered because of the job they were hired to do, and then in their sense, they're ... kind of hobbled or, you know, hands tied behind their back, that kind of thing,"" Kelly told the House Homeland Security Committee. ""And now, they feel more positive about things. I bet if you watch the morale issue, you'll ... be surprised going forward.""Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, who was previously in charge of the agency's enforcement and removal operations, earlier this month made a point of noting that his agents would enforce the law.In at least one case, it seems clear that Trump's order changed someone's fate. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, a mother of two in Phoenix, was arrested nearly a decade ago for using a false ID to get a job as a janitor at an amusement park. She pleaded guilty to a felony charge, but the government during the Obama years declined to deport her despite her being in the country illegally and a judge's order that she leave.

It is not a White House document,â€ù Spicer said.Later Friday, the office of Governor Greg Abbott released the following statement regarding the APâ€™s report:â€œThe Office of the Governor has not received, much less seen, a memo or request from the White House or Department of Homeland Security regarding the use of Texas National Guard troops for immigration enforcement. The White House has adamantly denied there are efforts underway to mobilize the National Guard for this purpose.â€ùAccording to the AP, the 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarization of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana.Four states that border on Mexico are included in the proposal â€” California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas â€” but it also encompasses seven states contiguous to those four â€” Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.Governors in the 11 states would have a choice whether to have their guard troops participate, according to the memo, written by U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general.While National Guard personnel have been used to assist with immigration-related missions on the U.S.-Mexico border before, they have never been used as broadly or as far north.The memo is addressed to the then-acting heads of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It would serve as guidance to implement the wide-ranging executive order on immigration and border security that President Donald Trump signed Jan. 25. Such memos are routinely issued to supplement executive orders.Also dated Jan. 25, the draft memo says participating troops would be authorized â€œto perform the functions of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension and detention of aliens in the United States.â€ù It describes how the troops would be activated under a revived state-federal partnership program, and states that personnel would be authorized to conduct searches and identify and arrest any unauthorized immigrants.Requests to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment and a status report on the proposal were not answered.The draft document has circulated among DHS staff over the last two weeks. As recently as Friday, staffers in several different offices reported discussions were underway.If implemented, the impact could be significant. Nearly one-half of the 11.1 million people residing in the U.S. without authorization live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 Census data.Use of National Guard troops would greatly increase the number of immigrants targeted in one of Trumpâ€™s executive orders last month, which expanded the definition of who could be considered a criminal and therefore a potential target for deportation. That order also allows immigration agents to prioritize removing anyone who has â€œcommitted acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.â€ùUnder current rules, even if the proposal is implemented, there would not be immediate mass deportations. Those with existing deportation orders could be sent back to their countries of origin without additional court proceedings. But deportation orders generally would be needed for most other unauthorized immigrants.The troops would not be nationalized, remaining under state control.Spokespeople for the governors of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico said they were unaware of the proposal, and either declined to comment or said it was premature to discuss whether they would participate. The other three states did not immediately respond to the AP.The proposal would extend the federal-local partnership program that President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration began scaling back in 2012 to address complaints that it promoted racial profiling.The 287(g) program, which Trump included in his immigration executive order, gives local police, sheriffâ€™s deputies and state troopers the authority to assist in the detection of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally as a regular part of their law enforcement duties on the streets and in jails.The draft memo also mentions other items included in Trumpâ€™s executive order, including the hiring of an additional 5,000 border agents, which needs financing from Congress, and his campaign promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.The signed order contained no mention of the possible use of state National Guard troops.According to the draft memo, the militarization effort would be proactive, specifically empowering Guard troops to solely carry out immigration enforcement, not as an add-on the way local law enforcement is used in the program.Allowing Guard troops to operate inside non-border states also would go far beyond past deployments.In addition to responding to natural or man-made disasters or for military protection of the population or critical infrastructure, state Guard forces have been used to assist with immigration-related tasks on the U.S.-Mexico border, including the construction of fences.In the mid-2000s, President George W. Bush twice deployed Guard troops on the border to focus on non-law enforcement duties to help augment the Border Patrol as it bolstered its ranks. And in 2010, then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced a border security plan that included Guard reconnaissance, aerial patrolling and military exercises.In July 2014, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to the border when the surge of migrant children fleeing violence in Central America overwhelmed U.S. officials responsible for their care. The Guard troopsâ€™ stated role on the border at the time was to provide extra sets of eyes but not make arrests.Bush initiated the federal 287(g) program â€” named for a section of a 1996 immigration law â€” to allow specially trained local law enforcement officials to participate in immigration enforcement on the streets and check whether people held in local jails were in the country illegally. ICE trained and certified roughly 1,600 officers to carry out those checks from 2006 to 2015.The memo describes the program as a â€œhighly successful force multiplierâ€ù that identified more than 402,000 â€œremovable aliens.â€ùBut federal watchdogs were critical of how DHS ran the program, saying it was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers, including on civil rights law. Obama phased out all the arrest power agreements in 2013 to instead focus on deporting recent border crossers and immigrants in the country illegally who posed a safety or national security threat.Trumpâ€™s immigration strategy emerges as detentions at the nationâ€™s southern border are down significantly from levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Last year, the arrest tally was the fifth-lowest since 1972. Deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally also increased under the Obama administration, though Republicans criticized Obama for setting prosecution guidelines that spared some groups from the threat of deportation, including those brought to the U.S. illegally as children.Last week, ICE officers arrested more than 680 people around the country in what Kelly said were routine, targeted operations; advocates called the actions stepped-up enforcement under Trump.(Â©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

Nearly one-half of the 11.1 million people residing in the U.S. without authorization live in the 11 states, according to Pew Research Center estimates based on 2014 Census data.Use of National Guard troops would greatly increase the number of immigrants targeted in one of Trumpâ€™s executive orders last month, which expanded the definition of who could be considered a criminal and therefore a potential target for deportation. That order also allows immigration agents to prioritize removing anyone who has â€œcommitted acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.â€ùUnder current rules, even if the proposal is implemented, there would not be immediate mass deportations. Those with existing deportation orders could be sent back to their countries of origin without additional court proceedings. But deportation orders generally would be needed for most other unauthorized immigrants.The troops would not be nationalized, remaining under state control.Spokespeople for the governors of Arizona, Utah, Nevada, California, Colorado, Oklahoma, Oregon and New Mexico said they were unaware of the proposal, and either declined to comment or said it was premature to discuss whether they would participate. The other three states did not immediately respond to the AP.The proposal would extend the federal-local partnership program that President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration began scaling back in 2012 to address complaints that it promoted racial profiling.The 287(g) program, which Trump included in his immigration executive order, gives local police, sheriffâ€™s deputies and state troopers the authority to assist in the detection of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally as a regular part of their law enforcement duties on the streets and in jails.The draft memo also mentions other items included in Trumpâ€™s executive order, including the hiring of an additional 5,000 border agents, which needs financing from Congress, and his campaign promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.The signed order contained no mention of the possible use of state National Guard troops.According to the draft memo, the militarization effort would be proactive, specifically empowering Guard troops to solely carry out immigration enforcement, not as an add-on the way local law enforcement is used in the program.Allowing Guard troops to operate inside non-border states also would go far beyond past deployments.In addition to responding to natural or man-made disasters or for military protection of the population or critical infrastructure, state Guard forces have been used to assist with immigration-related tasks on the U.S.-Mexico border, including the construction of fences.In the mid-2000s, President George W. Bush twice deployed Guard troops on the border to focus on non-law enforcement duties to help augment the Border Patrol as it bolstered its ranks. And in 2010, then-Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer announced a border security plan that included Guard reconnaissance, aerial patrolling and military exercises.In July 2014, then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry ordered 1,000 National Guard troops to the border when the surge of migrant children fleeing violence in Central America overwhelmed U.S. officials responsible for their care. The Guard troopsâ€™ stated role on the border at the time was to provide extra sets of eyes but not make arrests.Bush initiated the federal 287(g) program â€” named for a section of a 1996 immigration law â€” to allow specially trained local law enforcement officials to participate in immigration enforcement on the streets and check whether people held in local jails were in the country illegally. ICE trained and certified roughly 1,600 officers to carry out those checks from 2006 to 2015.The memo describes the program as a â€œhighly successful force multiplierâ€ù that identified more than 402,000 â€œremovable aliens.â€ùBut federal watchdogs were critical of how DHS ran the program, saying it was poorly supervised and provided insufficient training to officers, including on civil rights law. Obama phased out all the arrest power agreements in 2013 to instead focus on deporting recent border crossers and immigrants in the country illegally who posed a safety or national security threat.Trumpâ€™s immigration strategy emerges as detentions at the nationâ€™s southern border are down significantly from levels seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Last year, the arrest tally was the fifth-lowest since 1972. Deportations of people living in the U.S. illegally also increased under the Obama administration, though Republicans criticized Obama for setting prosecution guidelines that spared some groups from the threat of deportation, including those brought to the U.S. illegally as children.Last week, ICE officers arrested more than 680 people around the country in what Kelly said were routine, targeted operations; advocates called the actions stepped-up enforcement under Trump.(Â©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

The group consisted of representation from municipal staff, Port Hope Police Service, Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and the MNRF.McCormack noted in his report the local police and conservation authority support the municipal access fishing pass while the MNRF are in opposition.â€œThe rationale,â€ù McCormack wrote, â€œis that it is believed that this will restrict access to public fishing (which contradicts the Provincial Fish Strategy) and could set a precedent for other municipalities to follow suit.â€ùAccording to the report, staff discovered Essa Township is the only municipality in Ontario currently employing a similar fishing access pass.It launched the pass in 2007.â€œSince its inception, it does not appear that other municipalities have implemented similar programs,â€ù the report claimed.In recent seasons, Port Hope has struggled to curb illegal fishing on the river.For years, town hall regularly received complaints regarding snagging, gaffing and netting of fish, fishing in a sanctuary, harvesting roe and leaving remains to spoil, anglers fishing without a valid licence, and anglers keeping more fish than the daily limits.â€œA great deal of this activity occurs at night time,â€ù McCormack wrote.In 2016, town hall implemented the following action plans:â€¢ A zero tolerance approachâ€¢ Trained police officers to enforce the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Actâ€¢ Enforcement blitz by ministry officersâ€¢ About $8,000 allocated to the police budget to provide dedicated officers on foot patrol for the month of Septemberâ€¢ Increased signage in English, French and MandarinAs a result, in 2016, the ministry laid 63 fish and wildlife charges, 48 fish and wildlife warnings, conducted 437 hours of foot patrol and made 782 contacts; while police issued 68 fish and wildlife charges, 27 liquor license act charges, three bylaw infractions, conducted 151 hours of foot patrol and received 115 calls for service.The only data available from 2015 shows the police laid one fish and wildlife charge.McCormack argued the fishing pass program will help assist enforcement in issuing infractions.â€œThe program would assist enforcement officers in that individuals wearing the identifiable pass would have already produced a valid fishing license,â€ù McCormack wrote.â€œStrict enforcement of the fishing regulations is key to the success of filtering out and preventing future bad behaviors [sic].â€ùThe matter returns to committee of the whole on March 7.",Port Hope challenges illegal fishing with proposed $40 fishing pass,http://northumberlandnews.com/news-story/7142469-port-hope-challenges-illegal-fishing-with-proposed-40-fishing-pass/,http://northumberlandnews.com/news-story/7142469-port-hope-challenges-illegal-fishing-with-proposed-40-fishing-pass/2016-12-29T03:06:35.489515,-0.72%,36%,"Opinion: Compassion for children of illegal immigrants shouldnâ€™t outweigh lawDACA flies in the face of the nationâ€™s laws on immigration, say critics of the Obama directive.For curious readers, yes, illegal aliens in Georgia are being issued the same driverâ€™s licenses issued to foreign diplomats and Mercedes-Benz executives.The rule of law and its equal application is what is supposed to set us apart from the people President Kissâ€™ family escaped.KingIn her plea to continue to educate the illegal aliens to whom President Obama has illegally granted executive amnesty, Agnes Scott College President Elizabeth Kissâ€™ compassion is duly noted.Many of us who speak out for an equal application of American law â€“ even on immigration â€“ share Kissâ€™ concern for some of these young people.","Opinion: Compassion for children of illegal immigrants shouldnâ€™t outweigh lawDACA flies in the face of the nationâ€™s laws on immigration, say critics of the Obama directive.

""It's a criminal action, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time before me, but now it's really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.""With his statement and a series of early-morning posts he made on Twitter, Trump tried to shift attention from questions about contacts with Russia by Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the scandal is not those contacts but the leaks about them. He revived his claim that the allegations of a ""Russian connection"" were nothing more than a Democratic conspiracy, fed to a receptive news media to distract from the mistakes made by Clinton during the campaign.The White House has said Trump demanded Flynn's resignation Monday night after it was revealed that Flynn, a retired Army general, had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with a Russian diplomat.[DOCUMENT: Read Michael Flynnâ€™s resignation letter]But on Wednesday, the president said that Flynn had ""been treated very, very unfairly by the media,"" undercut by ""documents and papers that were illegally -- I'd stress that, illegally -- leaked.""Earlier, he had posted on Twitter, ""Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?). Just like Russia""The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported on the contacts Flynn had with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak. Flynn initially told Pence and others that he and Kislyak did not discuss matters of substance, like U.S. sanctions against Russia, but in the days after Trump's inauguration, the Justice Department notified the White House that Flynn had not been forthright about the conversations.The Times also disclosed broader contacts between Russian intelligence officials and people with ties to the Trump campaign -- including Paul Manafort, who briefly served as Trump's campaign chairman -- and Trump's business empire during and after the campaign, and other news organizations followed with similar reports. Current and former U.S. officials interviewed by the Times declined to identify other Trump associates contacted by the Russians.[PRESIDENT TRUMP: Timeline, appointments, executive orders + guide to actions in first 100 days]Manafort, in a statement, said he ""never had any connection to [President Vladimir] Putin or the Russian government -- either directly or indirectly -- before during or after the campaign.""""In the campaign, the only conversations on any topic that related to Russia, hacking etc were those following the coverage in the news,"" Manafort said. ""There was no link, that I am aware of, between the campaign or me with the Russian govt and anyone associated with it.""The president declined to address the reports of broader contacts with the Russians and, as he has at other times in recent days, took questions at his news conference only from pre-selected news organizations.The president ignored shouted questions about whether his advisers were in touch with Russian officials. His spokesman Sean Spicer said he wasn't aware of any such contacts and panned the Times report for relying on ""unnamed sources.""Earlier Wednesday, Trump tweeted that ""classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy. Very un-American!""He also wrote, ""The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!""[EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox]The president also praised a column by Eli Lake of Bloomberg View that criticized the selective leaking of intercepted communications between Flynn and Kislyak. Lake went on to suggest, however, that Flynn had been sacrificed to protect other officials, potentially including the president himself.Trump rejected allegations that his policy toward Russia was being compromised.""Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?"" he posted on Twitter.Multiple investigationsAccording to four national security officials with knowledge of the matter, intelligence agencies and the FBI are conducting multiple investigations to determine the full extent of contacts that Trump's advisers and associates had with Russia during and after the campaign.The investigations predate Flynn's dismissal.The FBI has two parallel ongoing investigations, one official said. A counterintelligence investigation is looking at Russian espionage activities and to what extent, if any, they involve communications with or collusion by U.S. officials. The second, a cybersecurity investigation, is looking into the hacking of U.S. political groups and operatives.Leading congressional Republicans on Wednesday joined calls by Democrats for a deeper look at contacts between Trump's team and Russian intelligence agents.""This is a moment for Republicans to put country ahead of party,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. said. ""There's only one or two times like this in your political career where you face a moment like this where what's good for your country may not be good for your party.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Wednesday that it is ""imperative"" that Congress investigate the matter.""If in fact there are campaign contacts between Trump officials and Russian intelligence officers that would be a very serious event and would justify the Senate forming a select committee to look at all things related to Russia,"" he said in a statement. ""The Russians have been trying to break the backbone of democracies all over the world, and clearly in my view, interfered in the 2016 election.""Some GOP lawmakers, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have resisted, saying that the existing congressional committees will continue their investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election.The Senate Intelligence Committee staff started collecting information in January on its broader investigation of Russia's alleged interference in last year's election, according to Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who sits on the panel. Manchin said Wednesday that he expects the committee to begin calling in witnesses starting later this month. Among those he would like to see testify are Flynn, Manafort and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who was fired after she refused to defend Trump's executive order on immigration.""We're going to do everything we can to be open and transparent,"" Manchin said in an interview. ""You need to clear it up.""Of the leaks of information, Sen. Tom Cotton said they are harmful and ""counterproductive.""""I'm certainly concerned about the leaks of very, very sensitive classified information,"" the Arkansas Republican said. ""The Intelligence Committee ... is also going to be taking a look at the leaks that have been occurring that ought not to have occurred.""Meanwhile, Democrats called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any executive branch investigation into the matter.Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sessions should not be involved because of potential conflicts of interest and because of Justice Department regulations that prohibit individuals with political ties to the subjects of an investigation from leading it.""When the FBI looks into a matter, they do so alongside prosecutors from the Justice Department,"" Schumer said. ""Those prosecutors should not be reporting to the first senator who endorsed Donald Trump's campaign.""Sessions was one of Trump's earliest and staunchest backers in Congress.A group of 11 Democrats wrote to Sessions and urged him to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate possible illegal communications between Flynn and representatives of the Russian government. The special counsel also would examine any attempts by Flynn and other White House officials to hide any wrongdoing, they said.The group, led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, included Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Schumer did not sign the letter to Sessions.Russian denialsIn Moscow, the Kremlin's spokesman dismissed reports of intercepted phone calls between Russian intelligence officials and members of Trump's presidential campaign.Speaking to reporters in Moscow, Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Putin, pointed to the anonymity of the sources, saying that the reports ""are not based on any facts, do not point to actual facts.""Asked about the allegations, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday that they ""prove once again there is a major internal, political game, you can call it bargaining, in the United States.""Russian lawmakers were more direct in trying to defend Trump.""This is not about information but about a high-precision information bomb,"" Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Federation Council's information committee, tweeted. ""The goal is to blow up the Trump administration.""Separately, Russian officials on Wednesday dismissed a statement by Spicer, Trump's spokesman, who said Trump expects Russia to return Crimea, which it annexed after a hastily called referendum in March 2014.""We never give back our territory,"" Zakharova told reporters.Peskov echoed Zakharova's remarks and added that Putin has been patient about explaining to his counterparts that the people of Crimea asked to join Russia because of their fears about the new government in Ukraine, and would keep delivering this message to the White House, too.Information for this article was contributed by Mark Landler and Richard Perez-Pena of The New York Times; by Julie Pace, Vivian Salama, Jonathan Lemire, Eric Tucker, Ken Thomas, Jill Colvin, Erica Werner, Catherine Lucey, Nataliya Vasilyeva, Richard Lardner, Erica Werner and Alan Fram of The Associated Press; by Chris Strohm and Steven Dennis of Bloomberg News; and by Frank E.

They have broken the law.â€ùThe university has removed all posters and called them â€œdeeply offensiveâ€ù during a statement by a Penn State University spokesperson, Philly.com reveals.â€œâ€‹The posters are unsigned and appear to be designed to provoke anger, fear and hateâ€‹.â€ùPenn State president Eric Barron revealed that this new development, following the recent travel ban, has been extremely difficult for everyone, including the facility and the international students.â€œThese recent developments affect not only our international students and faculty, but also every one of us.â€ùFollowing the travel ban, Barron advised all students, who are non-U.S. citizens, to carry proof of immigration status. Further, he advised them not to leave the country, if at all possible, due to the current circumstances.Witold Walczak, the legal director for the ACLU, decided to make his voice heard when he found out that Penn State was originally not going to remove all offensive anti-immigrant posters. Walczak mentioned that itâ€™s not only the offensive posters, but the whole anti-immigrant climate we are currently in right now.â€œYou generate fear and cause people to be suspicious of, and antagonistic to, people because they look and sound different.â€ùThe student newspaper revealed that the images of the posters were floating around social media earlier in the week.Penn State confirmed that each and every student at the university has earned their right into the college.â€œEvery student on this campus has earned the right to be here based on their academic qualifications and hard workâ€‹.

As of right now, President Trumpâ€™s travel ban has been overruled, but for how long, nobody really knows.According to a recent article by Inquisitr, President Trump is considering alternative options to help push the travel ban through. While his travel ban is not meant to threaten any legal immigrant in our country, many have been upset and fear that they will be ripped from their homes and sent to their original country of origin.Although it has been difficult for people to grasp the idea that Trump does not want that to happen, he simply wants to impose a temporary travel ban for illegal immigrants and refugees from seven countries, which have always been a security risk to America.As far as international students from Penn State University goes, they should have nothing to worry about, as it doesnâ€™t appear that the travel ban is going to take affect any time soon.Penn State University has taken the necessary efforts to remove all anti-immigrant posters. It is not known who is behind the offensive posters, as they are unsigned and nobody has come forward with any information.If you, or anyone you know has any information regarding who is behind the anti-immigration posters, please stand up for your fellow students and say something. While Penn State has mentioned that they support their students right of free speech, this type of message was meant to be offensive.[Featured Image by Shutterstock]",â€˜Report Any And All Illegal Aliensâ€™,http://www.inquisitr.com/3974342/penn-state-university-report-any-and-all-illegal-aliens/,http://www.inquisitr.com/3974342/penn-state-university-report-any-and-all-illegal-aliens/2017-02-15T07:49:42.494421,-0.30%,43%,"Information About Items that Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico Topping the list of illegal substances that are not allowed entry into Mexico are drugs.Transcript: What Items Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico?More Information About Items that Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico U.S. and Canadian citizens have actually been arrested for bringing in over-the-counter medications.The same drugs that are considered illegal in the U.S. and Canada are also illegal in Mexico, such as marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and heroine.However, before you travel to Mexico, you also have to think about what Mexico does not want you to bring into their country.","Transcript: What Items Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico?When traveling to Mexico, your main concern may be what you are allowed to take back across the border into the U.S. You may be counting your bottles of tequila and wondering what will be approved. However, before you travel to Mexico, you also have to think about what Mexico does not want you to bring into their country. Information About Items that Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico Topping the list of illegal substances that are not allowed entry into Mexico are drugs. You can bring in legal drugs, such as non-prescription medications but they must be in their original containers with no labels that have been tampered with. Prescription drugs are allowed but must also be in their original container so that the drug and quantity matches whatâ€™s on the label. The same drugs that are considered illegal in the U.S. and Canada are also illegal in Mexico, such as marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and heroine. More Information About Items that Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico U.S. and Canadian citizens have actually been arrested for bringing in over-the-counter medications. So, itâ€™s best to leave everything at home, if possible. Very harsh sentences are imposed on drug smugglers. And, a Mexican prison is not a place youâ€™d ideally want to spend any time.The next illegal items are firearms, ammunition, and explosive devices. Even empty cartridges are not allowed. Law enforcement, hunters, or people who carry weapons for personal protection are not immune to the law and must comply by leaving all weapons at home. Additional Information About Items that Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico There is a zero tolerance policy, so they will not listen to your excuses that you forget to take it out of your suitcase before you packed your bags for Mexico. In terms of explosives, you canâ€™t bring gun powder, black powder, fireworks, ammonia, diesel or any other Nitromethane-based fuel or solvent into Mexico. Discovery of any firearms, ammunition, or explosive devices will also get you a one-way ticket to a Mexican jail. While foods and animals are often prohibited entry into the U.S., these are two areas where Mexico is a bit more generous with some minor requirements.Dogs and cats are allowed but they must have a health certificate that verifies their shots. When it comes to food, there is a surprisingly long list of foods that are allowed. Some examples of what you can bring in will give you an idea of what is tolerated. For instance, you CAN bring in dehydrated or canned foods, packaged coffee, fresh or dry meats (only if coming from Canada or U.S.), candy (not lactic-based), dried spices, processed cheese (from U.S. and Canada only), processed sauces and soups without meat, straw articles, nuts and dry, herbal medicines.Lastly, in returning to prohibited items, you cannot bring in any anti-government or anti-Catholic propaganda, such as printed materials, signs, or clothing. This is considered highly offensive to Mexican authorities and citizens. If you are unsure of a particular item, be sure to check with the Mexican consulate before packing it.I'm Jonathon Stewart, with About.com.",What Items Are Illegal to Bring Into Mexico?,http://video.about.com/gomexico/What-Items-Are-Illegal-to-Bring-Into-Mexico-.htm,http://video.about.com/gomexico/What-Items-Are-Illegal-to-Bring-Into-Mexico-.htm2017-02-16T14:40:06.386046,-0.18%,40%,"Madrid â€“ The Spanish National Police on Tuesday announced the dismantling of â€œone of the most important illegal immigration and human trafficking ringsâ€ù, as part of an operation carried out in collaboration with Moroccan authorities.During this operation, the Spanish authorities arrested â€œseven Nigerian nationals who are members of a ring specialized in the sexual exploitation of Nigerian womenâ€ù, the same source pointed out in a statement.The information obtained during investigations have led security forces to three other Nigerian nationals, the statement said, adding that the police have gathered enough evidence to establish that these three individuals were running the illegal immigration network since 2008.The investigation was launched in 2015 after the discovery of one of the ringâ€™s victims who is aged 16, the Spanish police noted, adding that the victims were subjected to excessively harsh living conditions.What do you think?","Madrid â€“ The Spanish National Police on Tuesday announced the dismantling of â€œone of the most important illegal immigration and human trafficking ringsâ€ù, as part of an operation carried out in collaboration with Moroccan authorities.During this operation, the Spanish authorities arrested â€œseven Nigerian nationals who are members of a ring specialized in the sexual exploitation of Nigerian womenâ€ù, the same source pointed out in a statement.The information obtained during investigations have led security forces to three other Nigerian nationals, the statement said, adding that the police have gathered enough evidence to establish that these three individuals were running the illegal immigration network since 2008.The investigation was launched in 2015 after the discovery of one of the ringâ€™s victims who is aged 16, the Spanish police noted, adding that the victims were subjected to excessively harsh living conditions.Join the Conversation.

Ron Johnson, R-Wis., echoed the idea during a Feb. 3 CNN interview, claiming that a border fence in Israel has drastically cut illegal immigration along its southern border.""Israel ... had a real problem with illegal immigrants coming in from the southern border, about 16,000 in one year.","Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by ""99 percent"" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border.Need an example of a border wall that works? Look to Israel, President Donald Trump has repeatedly said.Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., echoed the idea during a Feb. 3 CNN interview, claiming that a border fence in Israel has drastically cut illegal immigration along its southern border.""Israel ... had a real problem with illegal immigrants coming in from the southern border, about 16,000 in one year. In two years, they constructed 143-mile fence, about $2.9 million per mile, and it cut that illegal immigration rate from about 16,000 to I think 18. Cut it by 99 percent,"" Johnson said.The United States needs to pay attention to Israel and how it has handled security issues, Johnson said.""They are under a constant state of threat. Threat of terrorism. They've dealt with it pretty effectively. We need to learn those lessons,"" Johnson added.Since Trump has signed an executive order to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, we were curious about references to Israelâ€™s border efforts and their success, as described by Johnson.Hereâ€™s what we found.Israel-Egypt border fenceIsrael has built multiple barriers along its borders with Egypt, Lebanon, Gaza Strip and West Bank, all as safeguards against terrorism and illegal immigration.In 2015, we looked into a claim from another Wisconsin official, Gov. Scott Walker, when he said that a 500-mile fence between Israel and the West Bank was to thank for a 90 percent reduction in terrorist attacks in Israel. Experts then told us that even though there had been a drop in terrorism, the data used for Walkerâ€™s analysis was outdated and the fence was only one reason for the decline.Johnson was specifically talking about a fence along the Israeli-Egyptian border.Johnsonâ€™s team referred us to a January 2013 article in the Jerusalem Post about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu touring a completed 143-mile fence along the Sinai border. The article noted that an additional 8 miles of fencing was still to be completed along mountainous terrain near Eilat. When fully completed, the fence would run from Kerem Shalom (where Sinai and Israel meet the Gaza Strip) to Taba on the Red Sea, according to the article.Fence construction started in November 2010 and came with a price tag of 1.6 billion Israeli shekels, the Jerusalem Post reported. The senator's office said an Israeli official told Johnson that the fence cost $415 million during a tour while Johnson was in Israel. (The Wall Street Journal in January 2013 pegged the fenceâ€™s cost at $416 million.)To determine a $2.9 million cost per mile, Johnson divided $415 million into the 143 completed miles cited in the 2013 article. (The cost per mile goes down to about $2.7 million when factoring in the total project of about 150 miles.)So Johnson appears largely correct about the cost of the wall. How about its success in keeping people trying to cross the border illegally out?That number checks out, too.This month, Johnson, who chairs the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, released a report titled ""Securing Israel: Lessons learned from a nation under constant threat of attack."" The report came after a trip Johnson made to Israel where he met the Israeli prime minister and other security officials.The report notes that the number of people illegally crossing the Israel-Egypt border was more than 16,000 in 2011 and less than 20 in 2016, a 99 percent decrease.Netanyahu recently touted his countryâ€™s southern barrier and gave a nod to Trump, tweeting on Jan. 28, ""President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea.""President Trump is right. I built a wall along Israel's southern border. It stopped all illegal immigration. Great success. Great idea _Ÿ‡®_Ÿ‡±_Ÿ‡º_Ÿ‡¸ â€” Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) January 28, 2017Experts we reached out to agree that illegal immigration along Egyptâ€™s southern border has indeed significantly dropped in the years after the fence was built and that Johnson's assessment of its costs and timeframe are sound.However, they warn against generalizing that the fence is the sole reason for the drop and raise objections in comparing Israelâ€™s border issues to those in the United States.The success of barriers such as a wall or fence depend on their scale and how heavily guarded they are, said Reece Jones, a political geography professor at the University of Hawai'i-Manoa and who has written about money spent on border security projects and their consequences.On a small scale and with many guards, walls can effectively stop movement, Jones said.But Israel and the United Statesâ€™ southern borders are significantly different.The Israel-Egypt border fence is about 150 miles.The U.S.-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles.Terrain conditions and number of agents needed to monitor the border are not comparable either, Jones said.""Most of the Israeli fence goes through open, arid terrain. Easy to access, easy to build, easy to monitor with agents,"" Jones said.The U.S.-Mexico border, on the other hand, includes very remote, mountainous terrain and spans the length of four states with cities closely intertwined with Mexico. Trump has said that border has 1 million legal border crossings daily, which experts have told us include people traveling back and forth for school, work and shopping.Investment in high-tech features such as drones, robots and sensors is also crucial for border security, not just fences, added Elisabeth Vallet, who leads a research team on border walls and is Raoul-Dandurand Chair at the University of Quebec at Montreal.Without those features, people may still go undetected or go around through another border. If illegal entries surge at another border point, then the effectiveness of the fence at one border comes into question, Vallet said.""While the numbers show a dramatic decrease in the number of entries, the amount of credit attributed to the fence is an issue of serious debate in Israel,"" said Yonatan Jakubowicz, director of research and public relations at the Israeli Immigration Policy Center, an NGO in Israel.Some were skeptical about the fenceâ€™s effectiveness when the idea was introduced in 2009, but the barrier received wider support after a terrorist attack on the border road in August 2011, Jakubowicz said.He also said that aside from the fence, additional policies have reduced illegal immigration.The number of illegal border crossings decreased drastically ""in an extremely short time"" after the implementation of an ""Anti-Infiltration Law"" in mid 2012, Jakubowicz said.Under the law, individuals caught illegally entering Israel could be detained for up to three years, Jakubowicz said. The number of people illegally crossing Israelâ€™s southern border decreased after the law came into effect, even though the fence was not fully completed, he said.""The fact that people continued to arrive even after the total completion of the fence, with fluctuations, proves that a barrier makes illegal migration more difficult, but not impossible,"" Jakubowicz said. ""Personal interviews and close inspection of migrant diaspora news outlets show that the combination of the fence and the immigration policies are to be attributed to these numbers, and not the fence alone.""Our rulingJohnson said Israel cut its illegal immigration rate by ""99 percent"" by constructing a 143-mile fence along its southern border.Israeli government data support Johnsonâ€™s statement. However, experts say the fence alone is not responsible for the dramatic decrease in illegal immigration, policies have also deterred illegal border crossings. Border security experts also caution about comparing Israel and the United Statesâ€™ southern borders -- the U.S.-Mexico border is much longer than the Israel-Egypt border, terrain conditions are different and more agents would be needed to monitor the U.S. border.Johnsonâ€™s statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","Border fence in Israel cut illegal immigration by 99 percent, GOP senator

The case against the 50-year-old Drew hinged on the governmentâ€™s novel argument that violating MySpaceâ€™s terms of service was the legal equivalent of computer hacking and a violation of the CFAA.The appellate courtâ€™s decision Wednesday, meanwhile, sets the stage for possible review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling conflicts with a 2006 decision by the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said employees lose â€œauthorizationâ€ù to company computers if their motives are disloyal.Congress adopted the CFAA to enhance the governmentâ€™s ability to prosecute hackers who accessed computers to steal information or to disrupt or destroy computer functionality. The CFAA prohibits a number of computer crimes, but the majority focus on accessing computers without authorization or in excess of authorization.At issue before both appellate courts was the area of the law granting the public the right to sue for damages.In both cases, the employers maintained the employees forfeited their â€œauthorized accessâ€ù when using a company computer to acquire confidential information to further their personal interests rather than the companyâ€™s interests.The San Francisco court ruled that, if a company has provided employees authorization to access internal materials, workers couldnâ€™t be sued under the anti-hacking statute unless they encroach into files in which they were not given permission.However, the Chicago appellate court said that an employee lost authorized access privileges to a laptop and was liable for damages for breaching a â€œduty of loyalty.â€ù The employee accessed confidential company data even though he was planning to quit his job to start a competing business, the court noted.By having such motives, the court concluded, the employee forfeited â€œhis authority to access the laptop.â€ùPhoto:phil g.",Court: Disloyal Computing Is Not Illegal,http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/09/disloyalcomputing/,http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/09/disloyalcomputing/2017-02-18T05:48:26.299563,0.73%,44%,"Sanctuary cities Six years after first attempt, fight over anti-sanctuary cities bill has changedBy JuliÃ¡n AguilarPublished 16 January 2017Bills targeting â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ù failed to pass the Texas Legislature in 2011 and 2015, but similar efforts this session have better chances of making it to Gov.Texasâ€™ proposed 2011 ban on sanctuary cities, the common term for local entities that donâ€™t enforce federal immigration laws, would have authorized local police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they arrested or detained.The Legislature is gearing up for a fight over â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ù bills â€” and not for the first time.Rick Perry, failed to pass the Texas Legislature in 2011, and similar legislation died in the Texas Senate in 2015.It led to fears that immigrants wouldnâ€™t report crimes and that officers could detain people based solely on skin color and turn them over to federal immigration officers.","Sanctuary cities Six years after first attempt, fight over anti-sanctuary cities bill has changedBy JuliÃ¡n AguilarPublished 16 January 2017Bills targeting â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ù failed to pass the Texas Legislature in 2011 and 2015, but similar efforts this session have better chances of making it to Gov. Greg Abbottâ€™s desk.The Legislature is gearing up for a fight over â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ù bills â€” and not for the first time. The current debate was foreshadowed by one in 2011, but this time, chances are better that a bill could make it to Gov. Greg Abbottâ€™s desk.Texasâ€™ proposed 2011 ban on sanctuary cities, the common term for local entities that donâ€™t enforce federal immigration laws, would have authorized local police to inquire about the immigration status of anyone they arrested or detained. It led to fears that immigrants wouldnâ€™t report crimes and that officers could detain people based solely on skin color and turn them over to federal immigration officers.â€œTexas Can Do Betterâ€ù and â€œNo Arizona Hateâ€ù were common mantras from critics of the legislation that reverberated around the State Capitol in 2011 â€” references to a controversial Arizona bill that expanded the immigration enforcement powers of local law enforcement and passed that stateâ€™s legislature in 2010.The plan, marked as an emergency item by then-Gov. Rick Perry, failed to pass the Texas Legislature in 2011, and similar legislation died in the Texas Senate in 2015. As expected, Republicans are taking another crack at passing a bill this year, and Abbott and Lt. Gov.

Charlie Geren (R-Fort Worth) â€” would allow local police to enforce immigration laws, but only if the officer is working with a federal immigration officer or under an agreement between the local and federal agency. It would also punish governments if their law enforcement agencies â€” specifically county jails â€” fail to honor requests, known as detainers, from federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers for sheriffs to hand over immigrants in their custodies for possible deportation. The punishment would be a denial of state grant funds.This time around, one border Democrat has conceded that he could support the detainer component of the current proposals, especially if it means it will keep more extreme measures at bay.Sen. JosÃ© RodrÃ_guez (D-El Paso), said data from ICE and testimony from county sheriffs earlier this year shows that county jail compliance isnâ€™t the issue Republicans make it out to be.","Sanctuary cities, immigration, Texas",http://homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20170116-six-years-after-first-attempt-fight-over-antisanctuary-cities-bill-has-changed,http://homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20170116-six-years-after-first-attempt-fight-over-antisanctuary-cities-bill-has-changed2017-02-20T14:44:08.582783,0.73%,36%,"Recruiting local law enforcement to help persecute illegal immigrants would also result in widespread violations of civil liberties, he said.CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Anti-Trump protestors are taking advantage of the federal holiday that celebrates Presidents to oppose the one that is currently in office.â€œThe Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country,â€ù she said.USA TODAY NETWORKLOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 18: Protesters participate in the Immigrants Make America Great March to protest actions being taken by the Trump administration on February 18, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.The program, initiated by the Obama administration in 2012, has protected about 750,000 immigrants.","CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Anti-Trump protestors are taking advantage of the federal holiday that celebrates Presidents to oppose the one that is currently in office.

Mark Green as the sponsor of the sanctuary city legislation.With President Donald Trumpâ€™s executive action on immigration wending its way through the federal court system, Tennessee lawmakers are pushing at least two immigration initiatives this legislative session. Neither is needed.One would prevent Tennessee municipalities from declaring themselves â€œsanctuary cities.â€ù Another would require state identification cards issued to foreign nationals to contain the word â€œalienâ€ù or some other identifying word or image.State Sen. Mark Green, R-Clarksville, has filed a bill that would withhold state funding for any municipality with policies that shield undocumented foreign nationals from federal immigration enforcement. Trump has issued an executive order that would withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities.State Sen. Todd Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga, and Rep. James Van Huss, R-Jonesborough, have introduced a similar bill.A sanctuary city is a loosely defined term for local jurisdictions that limit cooperation with the federal government on enforcing immigration laws against people who are here without appropriate documentation.No city in Tennessee has declared itself a sanctuary city, and there already is a state law prohibiting local governments from establishing policies of non-compliance with federal immigration lawKnoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero, in response to Trumpâ€™s executive order calling for the suspension of the U.S. refugee program and a temporary immigrant ban from seven majority-Muslim countries, said the city complies with federal law but welcomes immigrants.â€œWhile we are not a sanctuary city we are and will remain a welcoming city â€” welcoming city to people of all races, ages, genders, ethnicities, nationalities and religions,â€ù she said.Rogero said immigrants have made important contributions to East Tennessee. She also emphasized that building trust between immigrants and police enhances public safety.""The police department's longstanding policy is that when responding to a call, they do not ask about immigration status or citizenship status, it's not their job,â€ù Rogero said. â€œThey ask people for ID, not a passport. We want people to feel comfortable calling the police department if they need help.â€ùGreen, who has launched a campaign for governor, has said his bill is â€œproactive.â€ù Given his political ambitions, existing state law and the absence of sanctuary cities, however, â€œpanderingâ€ù seems a more appropriate word.State Rep.

Beyond that time, the United States will admit a maximum of 50 000 refugee in 2017, more than halving the 110 000-person limit set by former president Barack Obama.The US refugee program was previously frozen for three months following the September 11 attack in 2001.- Syrians -All Syrians, refugee or otherwise, are forbidden from entering the United States until further notice.According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Syrian war has forced 4.8 million people to flee the country since 2011.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in December it had recorded the deaths of 312 001 people since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011.- Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya -No visas will be issued for 90 days to migrants or visitors from seven mainly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.- Green card holders -The decree does not affect those who hold a US green card. Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly declared the entry of lawful permanent residents to be ""in the national interest.""However, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said that nationals from the seven countries named in the order should expect to be subject to increased border controls.- Visa holders -All visa holders coming from the seven specified countries are subject to the new order, with the exception of those who hold diplomatic visas or visas to international institutions such as NATO or the United Nations.Judges in at least four states have blocked part of the ban, ordering authorities to stop deporting refugees and other travelers stuck at US airports.- Binationals -The situation for individuals with dual nationality remains complex. US officials said on Saturday that American citizens who also have a passport from one of the seven barred countries are not affected by the order.An exemption is also granted to dual nationals holding British and Canadian passports.Britain said its nationals would not be subject to additional checks unless they traveled directly to the US from one of the listed countries.But dual nationals who hold passports from one of the seven countries plus an additional foreign country will not be able to gain entrance.- AFP",Who is affected by Trump's immigration order?,http://www.news24.com.ng/World/News/who-is-affected-by-trumps-immigration-order-20170130-2,http://www.news24.com.ng/World/News/who-is-affected-by-trumps-immigration-order-20170130-22017-02-15T14:09:01.524937,1.31%,44%,"Four Democrats who represent the Inland Empire in Congress are demanding to know more about recent federal actions targeting undocumented immigrants.In addition, the office of Rep.

We decided to take a deeper look.The Trump campaignâ€™s argumentIn an email, the Trump campaign claimed that many politicians give more attention and pledge more support to those in the country illegally than to veterans.Specifically, Trumpâ€™s campaign said Hillary Clinton ""downplayed"" the Department of Veterans Affairs scandal about veterans waiting for months for medical care. (We rated Mostly False a claim by Trump that Clinton is ""satisfied"" with the VA.)They also noted that she has not demanded ""the introduction of a massive veterans benefits bill her first 100 days as president."" Instead, she said pledged ""to fight for illegal immigrants and spend taxpayer dollars granting them benefits, such as Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare."" (We rated a similar claim by Trump Mostly False that Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days and to provide Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare for undocumented immigrants.)Trumpâ€™s campaign also pointed to a 2008 Washington Post article noting that a man had previously been convicted of drunken driving but not questioned about his immigration status. He later killed two people while drunk and speeding, and sentenced to 24 years in prison.""Illegal immigrants convicted of DUIs are often released without any immigration consequences,"" Trumpâ€™s press team wrote. ""But members of the military who receive DUIs are subject punishment from their commanding officers and court martial.""The campaign also said that in terms of financial resources, billions of dollars are spent at all levels of government on undocumented immigrants, about $950 million were budgeted for fiscal year 2016 to care for children who entered the country illegally without their parents, cost to house undocumented immigrants in prisons in fiscal year 2014 was $1.87 billion.Other than the anecdote about the DUI case, weâ€™re not sure any of these examples show how veterans are being treated worse than people living in the United States illegally.So we decided to directly compare the two groups using things Trump often talks about -- education, health care and tax and fiscal policy.EducationIn terms of K-12 public education, the Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that no one can be denied access, even if they are undocumented, said Irene Bloemraad, a sociology professor at the University of California.That equal access also applies to veterans, but presumably veterans are not seeking K-12 education, Bloemraad said. ""At best, we can conclude no advantage, one way or another, at this level of education,"" she said.That Supreme Court ruling does not apply to post-secondary education and itâ€™s up to states to set the rules regarding undocumented immigrantsâ€™ access to public colleges and universities, Bloemraad said.Two states -- Alabama and South Carolina -- bar undocumented students from enrolling in public postsecondary institutions. Georgiaâ€™s State Board of Regents does not allow undocumented students to enroll in selective public universities (institutions that admit fewer than apply), according to University Leaders for Educational Access and Diversity Network.""Veterans would presumably face no ban to enrolling,"" Bloemraad said. ""So clearly, veterans are not treated worse; rather, in some states undocumented students are in a much more difficult position.""A veteran resident can also pay in-state tuition rates and can apply for federal benefits for post-secondary education, she said.Higher education and training benefits are available to veterans, servicemembers and their families through federal programs such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill.Undocumented students are not eligible for federal financial aid. In some states, undocumented students are required to pay higher, out-of-state rates for their education, even if they have lived in that state most of their life, Bloemraad said.Overall: Advantage veterans.Medical careThe EmerÂ_gency MedÂ_ical TreatÂ_ment and Active Labor Act, enacted by Congress in 1986, provided that hospitals provide anyone emergency care until stabilized, said Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush.So undocumented immigrants, by law, can get immediate emergency care -- but so can veterans. In this regard, both groups are treated the same in case of medical emergencies.Undocumented immigrants are not eligible to buy health coverage through the Affordable Care Act.Veterans enrolled in the Veteranâ€™s Affairs health care system (about 9 million of the 22 million veterans) are not eligible for the Affordable Care Act, but others would be -- unless they are eligible or have other coverage such as Medicare or employer-sponsored insurance, Wilensky said.Still, veterans are eligible for medical care.Itâ€™s ""hard to think of an example where an illegal immigrant would get better care,"" Wilensky said. Some of the Veterans Affairs care is clearly substandard or delayed, but thatâ€™s a different problem, she said.Katherine Baicker, a health economist at the Harvard University, said there are limits to the programs and care available to undocumented immigrants. They are not eligible for Medicaid, for instance, she said.Veterans are eligible for Medicaid and those who qualify usually do not pay copays for Veterans Affairs health care, according to the Veterans Affairs Department.""I can't think of ways in which veterans have less access or lower quality care than undocumented immigrants,"" Baicker said.Overall: Advantage veterans.Taxes, Social SecurityVeteranâ€™s benefits generally are not subject to tax and many tax provisions benefit service members, said Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center.Pay earned while serving in a combat zone is exempt from federal income tax, he said.""I can't think of any tax issue that would hit troops harder than undocumented immigrants,"" Williams said.Veterans are entitled to Social Security benefits.Laws enacted in 1996 and 2004 block Social Security benefits paid to unauthorized immigrants or to any noncitizen without a work-authorized Social Security number at some point in time, according to the Social Security Administration.As the Associated Press has also noted, undocumented immigrants donâ€™t have the right to vote, donâ€™t have legal permission to work or to receive most government benefits.Veterans who are citizens have the right to vote, have job employment resources such as the Veterans Employment Center and may qualify for Veteran Affairs health benefits.Overall: Advantage veterans.Our rulingTrump said, ""Our veterans, in many cases, are being treated worse than illegal immigrants.""In some states undocumented immigrants are barred from enrolling in post-secondary institutions, or pay out-of-state tuition even if theyâ€™ve lived in that state most of their lives; veterans are eligible for federal benefits for higher education and training and are eligible for in-state tuition. Undocumented immigrants also arenâ€™t eligible for Medicaid, cannot buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act and cannot receive Social Security benefits, all of those services and benefits are available to veterans.Veterans also have the right to vote and are eligible for federal job placement resources.Veterans are entitled to several more benefits that are not offered to civilians, much less undocumented immigrants.We rate Trumpâ€™s statement False.",Donald Trump's False claim veterans treated worse than illegal immigrants,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/trump-says-veterans-treated-worse-illegal-immigran/,http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/donald-trump/trump-says-veterans-treated-worse-illegal-immigran/2017-02-17T03:23:10.162330,1.58%,41%,"Compared to 2015, the number of asylum seekers in Croatia has increased by as much as 959 percent.Interior Minister OrepiÄ‡ has repeatedly said that for many migrants Croatia is just a stopover.That is as much as 97 percent fewer illegal crossings than in January 2016, before an agreement between the European Union and Turkey was reached and before the closing of the passage on the so-called Western Balkan route.In January, there were only 1,959 illegal crossings of external borders of the European Union in the Western Balkans, announced Frontex, the agency in charge of the European Border and Coast Guard, reports VeÄçernji List on February 14, 2017.In January 2016, there were 65,300 attempted illegal border crossings.","In January, there were only 1,959 illegal crossings of external borders of the European Union in the Western Balkans, announced Frontex, the agency in charge of the European Border and Coast Guard, reports VeÄçernji List on February 14, 2017.That is as much as 97 percent fewer illegal crossings than in January 2016, before an agreement between the European Union and Turkey was reached and before the closing of the passage on the so-called Western Balkan route. In January 2016, there were 65,300 attempted illegal border crossings.Croatian Interior Minister Vlaho OrepiÄ‡ said that the number of migrants arriving on the Balkan route was negligible at the moment, but that the route was still the site of illegal criminal acts â€“ such as smuggling of people and goods.Most migrants on the route were people from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. Migrants from these countries are also the most numerous among asylum seekers in Croatia. Compared to 2015, the number of asylum seekers in Croatia has increased by as much as 959 percent. However, despite the fact that, after entering Croatia, they fill in the necessary documents and formally declare that they want to stay, for most migrants Croatia is not the desired final destination. Therefore, it is quite often that people who have requested asylum in Croatia are the ones who are later apprehended trying to illegally leave Croatia and reach Western Europe.Interior Minister OrepiÄ‡ has repeatedly said that for many migrants Croatia is just a stopover. And that is precisely the reason why Croatia has not fulfilled its commitment to accept 1,563 migrants as its quota for redistribution of European migrants, which Croatia is obliged to fulfil as a member state of the European Union. So far, Croatia has received just about 20 migrants, and another 50 from Greece and Italy are in the process of being relocated. â€œOne of the reasons for the slow fulfilling of the quota is that these people simply do not want to come to Croatiaâ€ù, said OrepiÄ‡.The Minister said he was satisfied with the way the police is stopping the entry of illegal migrants in Croatia, which is greatly helped by technical equipment which was recently acquired and in which the government has recently invested considerable funds.",Number of Illegal Crossings of Border Reduced by 97%,http://total-croatia-news.com/politics/16567-number-of-illegal-crossings-of-border-reduced-by-97,http://total-croatia-news.com/politics/16567-number-of-illegal-crossings-of-border-reduced-by-972016-12-28T12:01:16.935716,1.76%,37%,"And not all held in immigrant detention were undocumented.The DOJ was forced to later to admit that in reality, detention times exceeded a full year.In the 2003 case Demore v.

But then 15 years later cops showed up at Morataya's door once again.Police threw her into jail, this time along with an order of deportation. And like thousands of immigrants detained nationwide, Morataya would spend years behind bars, all the while trying to prove she had the legal right to stay in the United States.The right of due process is a core tenet of American values. But the issue before the U.S. Supreme Court in oral arguments on Wednesday raises fundamental questions about the scope of those rights for immigrants.Does the federal government have the authority to detain immigrants indefinitely? Or, should immigrants be given the opportunity for release on bond â€” like all U.S. citizens â€” once their detention time exceeds a certain limit?In the case before the high court, Jennings v. Rodriguez, an incomplete panel of eight justices will hear arguments out of a class action lawsuit filed by the ACLU.More than 1,000 immigrants claimed they faced prolonged detention times in facilities throughout California. And not all held in immigrant detention were undocumented.Like Morataya, many were legal permanent residents or green card holders, while others were seeking asylum.Related: Group Sues For DHS, ICE Records on Immigrants' ArrestsMorataya had been a longtime green card holder with legal status in the United States. Still she faced being sent back to a country she had not seen since she was a child.Had she been a full U.S. citizen, she would have been guaranteed a chance to appear before a judge to argue for her release. Her past conviction was a non-violent offense and as the sole breadwinner to her three American citizen kids, she wasn't considered a flight risk.Instead she was kept behind bars for the entire duration of her case.""It's either you stay and fight, or you get deported,"" Morataya said. ""I obviously had no life but here.""Suspected illegal immigrants are transferred out of the holding area after being processed at the Tucson Sector of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection headquarters in Tucson, Arizona, on Aug. 9, 2012. Ross D. Franklin / APMichael Tan, staff attorney for the ACLU's Immigrant's Rights Project, said that while immigrants with the weakest cases would quickly cycle out of detention, the people with the greatest chance of fighting deportation also suffered the harshest consequences.""This is one of the sad ironies of this case,"" Tan said. ""The people who have the longest period of detention are usually the ones with the strongest cases to stay in the U.S.""Congress has given the federal government broad authority to use mandatory detention as a tool to enforce immigration laws. But so far the courts have been inconsistent in answering whether immigrants can challenge their prolonged detention before a judge.Related: Report: Some Central American Families Arrested Before They Could Seek ProtectionFurther muddling the issue, previous decisions on immigrant detention were later found to be based on inaccurate information.In the 2003 case Demore v. Kim, the Department of Justice reported that detention times for immigrants averaged around five months. But those figures were grossly understated.The DOJ was forced to later to admit that in reality, detention times exceeded a full year. Acting Solicitor General Ian Heath Gershengorn apologized for the error in August â€”14 years after the high court used that data in its decision.Since Demore, lower courts have determined that there should be a bright line indicating how long detention without judicial review was considered unreasonable.Play FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Detained Central American Mothers Speak Out on 10th Day of Hunger Strike 1:10 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals weighed in last year, ruling that at the six month mark of detention, non-citizens must be given an opportunity to prove they are not a danger to the community or a flight risk if released.The Obama administration is now pushing back. In the government's brief filed this year, Gershengorn said it was not up to the courts to rewrite what Congress had already outlined.""Congress weighed the interests in controlling the border, protecting the public from criminal aliens, affording individual aliens adequate protections and opportunities for relief and review, and minimizing the adverse foreign-relations impact of U.S. immigration law,"" the DOJ wrote.Rachel Levenson, who is with the Immigrant Rights Project at NYU Law, says the case before the Court on Wednesday is an opportunity to strengthen procedural protections in what is already a vast immigrant detention system and in ways that align with American values.""There is a fundamental value in this country that people should not be locked up and the key thrown away without a judge even looking at their case,"" Levenson said. ""People have a right to their day in court.""For Morataya, it took 30 months of detention before a judge ultimately ruled that she could return to her family.All three of her children had to shuttle between caregivers and guardians while Morataya had been locked behind bars. Her oldest was just 18 at the time; her youngest about to enter Kindergarten.""Immigration made me feel like a menace to society when I really wasn't,"" she said.

We are, after all, a nation of immigrants.President Trump has barred the admission of refugees from any country for 120 days pursuant to Executive Order 13769 signed on Jan. 27. In this order, he has also denied any visa or immigration benefit to any immigrant or non-immigrant from any of seven countries, specifically, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen and Iran, all majority Muslim, which have been labeled â€œareas of concern.â€ùThe order also suspends admission until further notice of any Syrians as refugees. The president justifies this order by relying on Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which allows the president to suspend the entry of any alien or of any class of aliens into the United States whenever he finds that such entry would be â€œdetrimental to the interestsâ€ù of the United States.Sadly, our nation also has a long and distasteful history of discrimination against immigrants. In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed by Congress and prohibited the immigration of all Chinese laborers. In the Immigration Act of 1924, quotas were established for immigrants from Southern and Eastern European nations.Finally, before the start of World War II in 1939, our country turned away 900 Jewish refugees who had sailed from Hamburg, Germany and tried to gain permission to enter the United States through the port in Miami. Many of those turned away died in the Holocaust. Now, sadly, it appears we have returned to his immoral practice of discriminating against immigrants based on their national origin and religion.Refugees are vetted carefully and cautiously. It takes over two years for many to be allowed entry into the United States. The restructuring of the visa waiver program under Obama was working, and there was no reason to outright bar visa holders from these seven nations if they had been properly vetted and granted a visa.The executive order should be rescinded immediately and the president should look to work with Congress on passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that will address the infirmities with our countryâ€™s immigration laws in a just and humane manner, consistent with our best traditions as nation founded by immigrants and on immigration.Brandon Smoot is an immigration attorney in Tallahassee who graduated from FSU Law School.Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/2k7LOTI",Immigration ban immoral,http://Tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2017/02/09/smoot-immigration-ban-immoral/97687302/,http://Tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2017/02/09/smoot-immigration-ban-immoral/97687302/2017-02-15T09:18:15.103730,2.50%,40%,"Start Download Corporate E-mail Address: You forgot to provide an Email Address.Other examples could include taking action that could result in harm outside your network, and taking action in your network without proper consent.Offensive security or active defence against cyber attacks is illegal if it is tantamount to hacking back or vigilantism, says Steven Chabinsky, senior vice president of legal affairs at security startup CrowdStrike.This email address doesnâ€™t appear to be valid.By submitting my Email address I confirm that I have read and accepted the Terms of Use and Declaration of Consent.","Offensive security or active defence against cyber attacks is illegal if it is tantamount to hacking back or vigilantism, says Steven Chabinsky, senior vice president of legal affairs at security startup CrowdStrike.Download this free guide New technologies: a source of threat as well as a solution Learn about fighting the ever evolving ransomware, IoT botnet malware and data manipulation attacks.

( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS )OTTAWAâ€“Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has ordered a review into a CSIS metadata program that illegally stored data on innocent Canadians for almost a decade. Goodale said Thursday that he and Justice Minister Judy Wilson-Raybould are examining the circumstances that led CSIS and the Department of Justice to conclude the spy agency could collect and store data on â€œnon-threatâ€ù individuals indefinitely. The review was requested after a Federal Court ruled the practice was illegal late last year, Goodaleâ€™s office said Thursday night. â€œThe work that CSIS did was all based upon the considered legal opinions that they had from the Department of Justice,â€ù Goodale told the Star in an interview. â€œSo itâ€™s important to make sure that, from the operational side, which is Public Safety, but also the policy side, which is the Department of Justice, that we get this right.â€ùArticle Continued BelowRead more:Goodale speaks with The Star on illegal CSIS metadata program Goodale was speaking in response to newly-released documents that suggested CSIS was unable to determine how many Canadians were caught up in their metadata program. The serviceâ€™s Operational Data Analysis Centre had stored â€œassociated dataâ€ù â€” usually called metadata â€” on individuals that posed no threat to Canadaâ€™s national security. In 2016, a Federal Court justice ruled that the agencyâ€™s decision to keep that data indefinitely was unlawful.Metadata can include highly sensitive information like geolocation data, phone calls made or received, and other personal information. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have long relied on metadata to reveal a targetâ€™s movements and networks. CSIS stated that because metadata isnâ€™t tied to â€œpersonal details,â€ù like citizenship, they canâ€™t say how many Canadians were affected. In a statement Thursday, CSIS reiterated that all access to the ODACâ€™s databases was halted after the Federal Courtâ€™s ruling. â€œCSIS immediately halted access to, and analysis of, associated data until such time as we can propose and implement a solution addressing the Courtâ€™s findings,â€ù wrote Roxanne Ouellette, a spokesperson for the service. â€œWe are continuing to examine this issue.â€ù At a press conference in November, CSIS Director Michel Coulombe accepted the courtâ€™s ruling, but stood by the usefulness of the ODACâ€™s big data program. When asked if he would authorize a program like ODAC again on Thursday, Goodale said he wanted to wait until the joint review of the program was complete. He said the Security Intelligence Review Committee, which reviews CSIS operations, will also weigh in. â€œThis is a complex subject matter, and itâ€™s one that obviously caused the Federal Court considerable anxiety,â€ù Goodale said. â€œAnd any further comment about the fallout or the way forward will depend on that future (investigation) by both me and the minister of justice.â€ù In the documents tabled in Parliament, CSIS also revealed that it had briefed successive public safety ministers about the existence of the ODAC on eight separate occasions, beginning in 2006 when the program was established. But the agency did not distinguish in those briefings between â€œthreat-related and non-threat-relatedâ€ù data â€” in other words, they did not distinguish the suspected security threats from the innocent people they interacted with. NDP public safety critic Matthew DubÃ©, who requested the information from CSIS, questioned CSISâ€™s inability to provide the number of people the service has stored metadata on. â€œIt seems to me bizarre that they would be unable to quantify how much of it there is,â€ù DubÃ© said. â€œIt also surprises me that so little (personal information) is revealed by this data, you kind of wonder why they retain it in the first place and what use it is.â€ù",Goodale orders review into illegal CSIS metadata program,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/02/02/goodale-orders-review-into-illegal-csis-metadata-program.html,https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/02/02/goodale-orders-review-into-illegal-csis-metadata-program.html2017-02-21T02:27:31.061776,2.86%,49%,"NoneA Nexus Services employee holds one of the GPS tracking devices that one of their clients would strap around their ankle.Holly Marcus / Special to The News LeaderThe units have to be charged at least two hours every day and are waterproof to allow for bathing and swimming.","NoneA Nexus Services employee holds one of the GPS tracking devices that one of their clients would strap around their ankle.

President Donald Trump's immigration order sowed more chaos and outrage across the country Sunday, with travelers detained at airports, panicked families searching for relatives and protesters registering opposition to the sweeping measure that was blocked by several federal courts. (Photo: AP Photo/Seth Wenig)Re ""Trump vows to take ban to Supreme Court if necessary,"" Feb. 7 USA Today article:President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration ban risks national security by helping ISIS and Al-Qaeda recruitment.Since 2011, we have had the strictest vetting for entry into the U.S. The tedious, taxing and costly process can drag as long as three to five years for temporary visas and refugees, and up to 20 years for permanent residency extended to family members of U.S. citizens if they wish to emigrate.Trumpâ€™s executive order on immigration is essentially the same as the current policy, except with the added element of racism against Muslims, and anyone perceived as Muslim.PROTESTS: People in more than 30 cities protest against Trump's orderASSISTANCE: Cuomo, AG pledge help to immigrants affected by Trump banQUESTION OF THE WEEK:â€‹ 5 locals sound off on Trump's travel banTrump has canceled 100,000 temporary and family repatriations, and refugee visas. To be reinstated, all have to go to the back of the line, if not dead by then due to violence in the region, or natural causes.Trump has pandered to the worst radical elements of this country promoting intolerance of Muslims and their religion.Many Americans of Iranian heritage are seriously considering immigrating to Canada, Switzerland or Scandinavian countries. They can no longer travel to their country of birth or ancestry where most still have close family and cultural ties; their Iranian families can't visit with them in the U.S. either.The ban is a misguided and inhumane executive order, antithetical to American values. It is imperative the courts and Congress provide proper checks and balances to prevent the Trump Administration from taking this country in the wrong direction.The executive order serves to fragment families, intimidate educated and productive Americans to leave our country, and deters highly educated foreign nationals, many Iranians, from considering the U.S. as a destination.Does President Trump want to make America great? If so, why is he destroying families of very productive and law-abiding immigrants and their U.S.-born offspring? Does he not recognize that Iranians, especially those naturalized in the U.S., are by and large secular, spiritual humans?Does Trump intend to impose heavy sanctions against Iran, to turn the 80 million American-loving ordinary Iranians against us, and then follow up with the military strikes to ruin the ancient country? Would Americans once again stand for such injustice?What is great about this country is the outpouring of American opposition to Trumpâ€™s â€œbanâ€ù and other ill-conceived executive orders.Before it is too little too late, â€œWe, the American peopleâ€ù must rise and stand up united, put aside minor differences and legally take back our country via 100 percent voter participation; first the House and the Senate in two years, and the presidency in four.The U.S. as a nation has been loved by many world citizens, including millions of Iranians, who despite their government's repressions, spontaneously poured into the streets in millions to hold candlelight vigils in honor of those innocents killed by the despicable terrorist acts on Sept. 11, and to cherish American values.Unfortunately, the Trump Administration doesnâ€™t espouse American values. Our nation deserves an urgent back-to-normal state of mind and equal opportunity for all Americans.The writer, an Ossining resident, is a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Iran.

The media have blatantly sought to undermine Trumpâ€™s initiatives.Judge James Robart, who serves on the District Court for the Western District of Washington State, asked the Department of Justice representative, â€œHow many arrests have there been of foreign nationals for those seven countries since 9/11?â€ù Robart then continued, saying, â€œThe answer to that is none, as best I can tell.â€ùWell, Judge Robart is wrong. Data provided to Congress indicates that between September 11, 2001 and December 31, 2014, â€œat least 60â€ù persons from those seven countries were convicted â€œof terror-related offenses,â€ù writes Byron York for The Washington Examiner. There may have been more, since an additional 129 persons convicted of these crimes were â€œof unknown origin,â€ù York reports.Yet ABC News sought to downplay the security risk individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen pose. Instead, it reports that â€œOnly eight of the 78 attacks that appeared on a White House list of terrorist incidents over the past two years were committed by individuals from the seven countries affected by Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration orderâ€_â€ùIn other words, ABC is arguing that the travel pause would have little national security benefit. â€œIn fact, the list provided by the White House shows Americans were responsible for more attacks than those from the seven banned countries combined,â€ù reports ABC News.The media have clearly chosen a side in the debate about the travel pause, and are willing to deceive their audience. In a recent appearance on CNNâ€™s The Situation Room, Wolf Blitzer got into a discussion with Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID) over Obamaâ€™s immigration record, and its similarity to Trumpâ€™s recent immigration executive order.â€œThereâ€™s absolutely no evidence that this [Trumpâ€™s action] is unconstitutional or illegal,â€ù said Labrador, a former immigration attorney, on CNN. â€œIn fact, the President of the United States, our previous president, President Obama, did the same actions three times during his administration. There wasnâ€™t a single protest.â€ùâ€œThere were some nuanceâ€”there were some differences. We donâ€™t have to go through all of that,â€ù replied Blitzer.Why did Blitzer not want to get into specifics with Rep. Labrador? It might have informed his viewers. Instead, Blitzer aired a misleading clip featuring former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani.According to the edited clip, Giuliani stated, â€œWhen he [Trump] first announced it, he said Muslim ban. He called me up, he said, put a commission together, show me the right way to do it legally.â€ùBlitzer doubled down after airing the misleading Giuliani clip, saying, â€œSo, basically, what Rudy Giuliani helped him come up with was this formula for having a Muslim ban, but not calling it a Muslim ban.â€ùLABRADOR: Youâ€™re misleading a little bit, Wolf.BLITZER: Tell me why.LABRADOR: If you listen to the entire interviewâ€_Rudy Giuliani saidâ€_that a Muslim ban would be unconstitutional, illegal.BLITZER: You believe that?Blitzer, like so many in the media, is skeptical that Trump might have had other than bigoted motives. He is clearly taking a side in this argument, and abandoning journalistic impartiality.NBC had been called out just the day before for showing this deceptively edited clip. In full context, Giuliani continued by saying, â€œAnd what we did was we focused on, instead of religion, danger. The areas of the world that create danger for us, which is a factual basis, not a religious basis. Perfectly legal, perfectly sensible, and thatâ€™s what the ban is based on.â€ùOpponents of Trumpâ€™s travel pause claim that the Presidentâ€™s immigration executive order is religiously motivated and discriminatory. So, too, The Wall Street Journal reports that critics note that â€œall seven affected nations are majority Muslimâ€_â€ùThe media, and Democrats, are engaging in hysteria by labeling this a â€œMuslim ban.â€ù This is worse than hyperboleâ€”it is deception. After all, Indonesia, Pakistan, Egypt, and other countries have significant Muslim populations and yet have not been blocked. An estimated 85 percent of all Muslims are not affected by Trumpâ€™s executive order.â€œWe are right now contemplating no other countries,â€ù Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told Congress this week, admitting the executive order was rolled out too hastily, for which he himself took the blame.â€œThe bottom line is that Trump is improving security screening and intends to admit refugees at close to the average rate of the 15 years before Obamaâ€™s dramatic expansion in 2016,â€ù wrote David French for National Review, in a sober analysis of what the executive order does and does not do. â€œObamaâ€™s expansion was a departure from recent norms, not Trumpâ€™s contraction.â€ùTo his detriment, President Trump appears to be getting in the way of his own potential success. He argued at a recent meeting of law enforcement officials in Washington that â€œA bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this.â€ù In other words, he argued, a clear reading of the law should grant the government victory in this case.This is a misstep by Trump. It is, as The Hill reports, â€œhighly unusual for presidents to publicly comment on court cases dealing with their policy proposals,â€ù especially when a case is open.Trump is also putting the judiciary in a position to directly challenge him; he has made this into a high-profile showdown with his inept utterances.Trump also asserted that the media have not sufficiently covered terrorist incidents. Trump told troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa this week that â€œItâ€™s gotten to a point where itâ€™s [terror] not even reported, and in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesnâ€™t even want to report it.â€ù His administration then issued a list of 78 attacks that had taken place between September 2014 and December 2016. The liberal media had a field day with the list, citing misspellings and proclaiming that they had covered many of those events, often for days at a time. National Public Radio (NPR), for example, claims this was false, because most news organizations covered the attacks in Paris; San Bernardino, California; the Orlando night club; and others.But, as Robert Spencer points out for Jihad Watch, it is not the act of covering the attacks for which the media have been derelictâ€”it is how these events are covered. â€œBut in virtually all cases, they did all they could to obscure the motivating ideology behind those attacks,â€ù writes Spencer. â€œThey deliberately conceal and/or misrepresent the aspects of them that make it clear that theyâ€™re Islamic jihad attacks. This is in accord with the guidelines of the Society of Professional Journalists, which tells journalists not to connect Islam with terrorism, and to obscure that connection wherever possible.â€ùOnce a terrorist has been confirmed to have Islamic jihadist ties, the media then question whether the attacker was a â€œself-radicalized lone wolf.â€ù Whether these jihadi terrorists were inspired by the Islamic State or al Qaeda, or were directed members of these terrorist groups, makes little difference. Islamic jihadist terrorists drink from the same poisonous well.Perhaps the starkest example of the treatment of such an act, by the Obama administration and the media, was the case of Major Nidal Hasan, who murdered 13 and injured 32 others at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas back in September of 2009. For approximately five years the case was treated as â€œworkplace violence.â€ù It wasnâ€™t until 2015â€”nearly three years after 150 family members who struggled to pay their medical bills filed a lawsuitâ€”that the government switched its position and gave the wounded victims Purple Hearts, which carried with them added medical benefits and the acknowledgement that they had been wounded in the line of duty.As long as the public allows it, the media will continue to avoid honest discussions about the real terror threat that jihadists and potential terrorists from these seven countriesâ€”and othersâ€”pose to the health and welfare of American citizens.http://www.aim.org/aim-column/trumps-immigration-pause-and-the-media-backlash/","Trumpâ€™s Immigration Pause, Media Backlash",http://beforeitsnews.com/immigration/2017/02/trumps-immigration-pause-the-media-backlash-2454592.html,http://beforeitsnews.com/immigration/2017/02/trumps-immigration-pause-the-media-backlash-2454592.html2017-02-16T21:53:08.754730,3.13%,18%,"Sports5.ph also features player and team profiles and statistics across multiple sports and has online shows catered to the sports aficionado.It is the first official local sports website to livestream PBA, NCAA games and other sporting events, as well as video on demand, all on HD format.Sports 5 is the online sports hub of TV5.","Sports 5 is the online sports hub of TV5.

(Screen grab from CBS)(CNSNews.com) - Speaking about President Trump's contested executive action on immigration, ""I think he ought to throw it in the trash,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.I think this executive order is so bad and so poisoned, and its genesis is so bad and terrible, that he ought to just throw it in the trash can, and for two reasons. First reason, it doesn't really make us safer. It doesn't focus on the areas where we really need to tighten up. They are, number one, on lone wolves. The last two major terrorist incidents in America didn't occur through immigrants. They were Americans importuned by the evil ISIS. And no less an authority than John McCain, Republican, has said that this order actually encourages lone wolves.And the second is something called the visa waiver program. It is very easy to come to America from countries that we have always regarded as friendly. There are, I think, 27 of them. But these days, there are would-be terrorists who have infiltrated places like Belgium and France. And they can come into this country much more easily than someone who is a refugee from the seven countries the president mentioned. That needs real tightening up.Schumer said Trump's executive order is ""just un-American and unconstitutional"" because it's a ""religious ban."" ""We believe in immigrants in this country. And we don't believe in a religious test.""Both the president and his aides have firmly denied that the order affecting only seven of the dozens of Muslim-majority countries is a ""Muslim ban."" They say the temporary pause in immigration from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen has more to do with the inability to properly vet people coming to the U.S. from those countries where security is minimal or non-existent.Schumer said the order -- a temporary immigration pause in six of the countries -- ""hurts us economically. When immigrants don't come to this country, it hurts our job creation, our job growth. Silicon Valley is very worried that a lot of their jobs are going to have to go to Vancouver, where Canada has a much more forward-looking immigration policy.""Host John Dickerson asked Schumer, ""Why not have a pause?""""Well, first, it is not a pause for Syria,"" Schumer replied. (Immigration for Syrians is indefinitely suspended.)""And, second, it cuts against the grain of what America is all about, which is, it embodies a religious test. That is how Rudy Giuliani set it up. That is, John -- that's how President Trump talked about it. And it doesn't focus on the areas that need to make us safe.""Schumer noted that a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- which upheld a lower court's temporary restraining order -- cited the Trump administration's failure to show evidence that the executive order would make the nation safer.Appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" White House Senior Policy Adviser Stephen Miller said the Trump administration is ""pursuing every single possible action to keep our country safe from terrorism.""He said the options include issuing ""additional executive actions"" to replace the contested order.",Schumer on Trump's Immigration Order,http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/schumer-trumps-immigration-order-throw-it-trash,http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/schumer-trumps-immigration-order-throw-it-trash2017-02-15T13:28:03.081591,3.19%,40%,"In his new book â€” â€œImmigration Warsâ€ù â€” Bush said that illegals should not get a pathway to citizenship.The former Florida governorâ€™s stance marked a major change from his longtime position.â€œPermanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship,â€ù Bush said in the book, written with attorney Clint Bolick.Urgent:Urgent:Florida Sen.

The former Florida governorâ€™s stance marked a major change from his longtime position.â€œPermanent residency in this context, however, should not lead to citizenship,â€ù Bush said in the book, written with attorney Clint Bolick. â€œIt is absolutely vital to the integrity of our immigration system that actions have consequences â€” in this case, that those who have violated the laws can remain but cannot obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship.â€œTo do otherwise would signal once again that people who circumvent the system can still obtain the full benefits of American citizenship,â€ù Bush continued. â€œIt must be a basic prerequisite for citizenship to respect the rule of law.â€ùRubio, whoâ€™s considered Bush a longtime mentor, said that his objectives for comprehensive immigration reform envisioned a process whereby illegals who passed background checks and paid fines could receive a non-immigrant visa.They would remain in that status for a long time before being able to apply for citizenship.â€œAfter that, all they get is a chance to apply for a green card, and theyâ€™d have to do it through the same process as everybody else,â€ù he told The Hill.Both Rubio and Bush are considered possible contenders for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.",Rubio Splits With Bush on Immigration,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/rubio-jeb-bush-immigration/2013/03/04/id/493088,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/rubio-jeb-bush-immigration/2013/03/04/id/4930882017-02-15T18:44:34.278955,3.33%,47%,"NoneField workers remove weeds from an avocado orchard at Wild Swan Ranch in Moorpark.Some local growers are concerned about possible restrictions on immigration in the Trump administration and what impact it would have on the county's agricultural workforce.CHUCK KIRMAN/THE STAR","NoneField workers remove weeds from an avocado orchard at Wild Swan Ranch in Moorpark.

(Photo: CHRISTIAN TORRES, AP)Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said he and five other California sheriffs met with the nation's new attorney general this week and made it clear that they don't want to get involved in enforcing immigration laws.With a new presidential administration in place, Dean and his peers traveled to Washington, D.C., to have discussions with federal officials on issues that are important to them, he said.During his trip, Dean met with Sen. Jeff Sessions three hours before Sessions was confirmed as attorney general on Wednesday. Dean also met with FBI Director James Comey, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Westlake Village.The sheriff said Sessions ""didn't say much,"" but among the issues Dean and the other sheriffs discussed was their policy on local immigration enforcement. They reiterated their stance that they don't want to get involved in direct enforcement of immigration laws but that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would continue to have access at county jails.Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean (Photo: STAR FILE PHOTO)With border security and immigration issues a priority with Donald Trump, the new Republican president has issued an executive order stating that the secretary of homeland security will begin working with governors and local officials to enter agreements to let qualified state and local law enforcement officers perform the functions of immigration officers.The order prompted Dean and the police chiefs in Ventura County to issue a joint statement that it's the job of local law enforcement agencies to enforce state laws and city statutes, while the federal government controls immigration laws.Currently, immigration officers have access to a list of inmates in Ventura County jail who are foreign-born. Dean has said ICE will continue to have that access but that with the exception of matters that could affect homeland security, the Ventura County Sheriff's Office and other local law enforcement agencies plan to have no other involvement in immigration matters.Attorney General Jeff Sessions holds a meeting with the heads of federal law enforcement components at the Department of Justice in Washington on Thursday. (Photo: ASSOCIATED PRESS)Also expressed to Sessions were concerns that any investigation by the Department of Justice into local law enforcement agencies be done with ""fairness and equity"" and that federal officials ""not paint us with a bad brush"" after one specific incident, Dean said.One of the top issues Dean discussed, and not just with Sessions, during his trip to the nation's capital was funding to give support to inmates with mental health issues.Also discussed was the asset seizure and forfeiture program under which seized drug money goes to local agencies that get involved in such operations as Drug Enforcement Administration task forces that target high-profile narcotics dealers. Another topic was the military surplus program, through which federal authorities give excess military supplies to state and local law enforcement agencies.Dean described his trip to Washington as ""routine,"" saying he went on such a trip two years ago and met the same players under the administration of then-President Barack Obama. He said this year's trip was ""timely"" to meet those in the Trump administration.""It was probably the most productive four or five days in Washington that we've ever had,"" said Dean, who got back to California on Friday.Read or Share this story: http://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/2017/02/11/sheriff-discusses-immigration-new-attorney-general/97780710/",Sheriff discusses immigration with new attorney general,http://Vcstar.com/story/news/local/2017/02/11/sheriff-discusses-immigration-new-attorney-general/97780710/,http://Vcstar.com/story/news/local/2017/02/11/sheriff-discusses-immigration-new-attorney-general/97780710/2017-02-15T12:53:35.833463,3.85%,50%,"Vessel News --More than 1,000 illegal immigrants, or residents who are not U.S. citizens, have been free to vote illegally in Virginia.In both years, Obama won Virginia.The bombshell disclosure was made in a report released by the Virginia Voters Alliance and its counsel Public Interest Legal Foundation.The report found that the most illegal votes were cast in 2012, followed by 2008, the year President Obama was elected to his first term.Itâ€™s a felony for non-citizens to vote in Virginia.","Vessel News --More than 1,000 illegal immigrants, or residents who are not U.S. citizens, have been free to vote illegally in Virginia.The bombshell disclosure was made in a report released by the Virginia Voters Alliance and its counsel Public Interest Legal Foundation.â€œThe problem is most certainly exponentially worse because we have no data regarding aliens on the registration rolls for the other 125 Virginia localities.â€ùThe 1,046 Virginia voters may just be the tip of the iceberg, as itâ€™s only the number found in eight Virginia localities, the report reads.

But Ohio, where Kasich is governor, is part of a multi-state lawsuit blocking President Obama's 2014 executive order that would offer temporary legal status to millions.We exchanged 14 emails with Rob Nichols, Kasich's press secretary, hoping for clarification. He said we're ""testing the wrong part of the sentence"" and declined to provide information about Kasich's record until we established what Clinton meant by ""from the beginning.""

Then he stopped responding.Donald TrumpWell, there's the wall. Also his insistence that Mexico is sending the United States ""drugs, crime, and rapists."" Enough said.Bernie SandersSanders has a strong record on immigration issues, Warren Gunnels, his senior policy advisor, replied. Sanders supports ""comprehensive immigration reform and a path towards citizenship for 11 million people today who are living in the shadows,"" the senator said in a MSNBC Democratic primary debate in New Hampshire in February.He voted for the Dream Act in 2010, which would have legalized immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He also supported the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill in 2013. This bipartisan legislation created a path for people already in the United States, focused on reducing visa backlogs, and improved work visa options for low-skilled workers.While he was in the House of Representatives in the '90s, he voted against House Amendment 778, which would have to prohibited undocumented people's access to Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter programs. He voted for Amendment 968 to H.R. 2202, which removed a section barring ""illegal aliens from receiving public assistance.""In 2006, he voted against the Immigration Law Enforcement Act, which allowed local police to aid in ""enforcement of immigration laws, to provide for effective prosecution of alien smugglers, and to reform immigration litigation procedures.Hillary ClintonWe asked Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for Hillary for America, to provide evidence to substantiate the ad's claims.Schwerin told us that while in law school, Clinton worked with Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of the Children's Defense Fund. She completed research on education and health of migrant children that would later be used in Senate hearings investigating the living and working conditions of farm workers.He also told us about her job on George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign, where she worked closely with Franklin Garcia, a well-respected union leader, registering Latino voters in south Texas, which was chronicled in a Buzzfeed article about her ties to the Latino community.While serving in the Senate, Clinton co-sponsored the Safe, Orderly, Legal Visas and Enforcement Act of 2004 with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Clinton co-sponsored the Dream Act in 2003, 2005 and 2007, which helped give immigrant students access to higher education, among other things.As Secretary of State in May 2011, Clinton called immigrants a ""source of vitality"" for the U.S. at the Council of the Americas 41st Washington Conference. She also supported Obama's commitment to comprehensive immigration reform during those remarks.During the campaign, Clinton has stressed that Sanders voted against the comprehensive immigration reform bill brought by Arizona Sen. John McCain and the late Sen. Kennedy six times. She voted yes.But, explaining that vote in 2007, Sanders said ""it made no sense"" to bring millions of ""guest workers"" into the country when it could drive down wages of U.S. employees.Gunnels, in a recent email, said Sanders also thought the bill ""lacked badly needed protection"" for immigrant voters and noted that Hispanic advocacy groups such as The League of United Latin American Citizens, The Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, and The American Immigration Lawyers Association also opposed the bill.Drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants is another issue that flared on the debate stage last month in Miami.Clinton says she supports opening up driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. So does Sanders. But in 2007, as Sanders pointed out in the debate, Clinton said as president she would not support that.Our rulingHillary Clinton has long supported the immigrant community: from law school to the Senate to the Cabinet, and she's built a strong record of what her ad calls ""immigration reform.""She may well have been at it ""from the beginning,"" but to say she is the ""only"" candidate supporting ""immigration reform"" over a career is to minimize Sanders' position on the issue.Hillary's campaign can trace her support back to law school. As for the ""beginning"" for Sanders, we don't know what positions he took as a young socialist, but we can track his immigration record back to beginning of his legislative career in Washington.Sanders' voting record and his immigration reform plan show consistent support for a path to citizenship, despite his opposition to the 2007 bill. And remember, Clinton herself seemed to stumble on drivers' licenses in 2007.Because the statement contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",Clinton reaches too far on immigration claim,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2016/apr/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-reaches-too-far-immigration-claim/,http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2016/apr/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-reaches-too-far-immigration-claim/2017-02-21T10:40:54.298498,4.05%,36%,"Foreign governments simply do not have a get-out-of-court-free card when they commit serious felonies in America against Americans.We argue that Ethiopia must be held accountable for wiretapping Mr. Kidane, just as any other actor would be.Otherwise, there simply is no â€œinternational spyingâ€ù exception to the law for foreign governments, nor should there be.And when foreign governments break U.S. law, U.S. courts have the power to hold them accountable.Earlier this week, EFF told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that Ethiopia must be held accountable for its illegal wiretapping of an American citizen.","Earlier this week, EFF told the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that Ethiopia must be held accountable for its illegal wiretapping of an American citizen. Foreign governments simply do not have a get-out-of-court-free card when they commit serious felonies in America against Americans. This case is the centerpiece of our U.S. legal efforts to combat state sponsored malware.In February 2014, EFF filed suit against the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia on behalf of our client, Mr. Kidane, an Ethiopian by birth who has been a U.S. citizen over a decade. Mr. Kidane discovered traces of Gamma International's FinSpy, a sophisticated spyware product which its maker claims is sold exclusively to governments and law enforcement, on his laptop at his home in suburban Maryland. A forensic examination of his computer showed that the Ethiopian government had been recording Mr. Kidaneâ€™s Skype calls, as well as monitoring his web and email usage. The monitoring, which violates both the federal Wiretap Act and Maryland state law, was accomplished using spyware that captured his activities and then reported them back to a command and control server in Ethiopia controlled by the government. The infection was active from October 2012, through March 2013, and was stopped just days after researchers at the University of Torontoâ€™s Citizen Lab released a report exposing Ethiopia's use of use of FinSpy. The report specifically referenced the very IP address of the Ethiopian government server responsible for the command and control of the spyware on Mr. Kidaneâ€™s laptop.The Ethiopian government responded to the suit with the troubling claim that itâ€”and every other foreign governmentâ€”should be completely immune from suit for wiretapping American citizens on American soil. Ethiopiaâ€™s filing rests on several logic-challenged premises. Ethiopia claims that the recording of Mr. Kidaneâ€™s Skype calls and Internet activity at his home in Maryland actually took place in Ethiopia, and is therefore beyond the reach of any U.S. court. Worse still, Ethiopia claims that it had the ""discretion"" to violate U.S. law, reducing the Wiretap Act to something more like a traffic violation than a serious felony. Interestingly, Ethiopia does not actually deny that it wiretapped Mr. Kidane.Yesterday, EFF and its co-counsel at Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi, filed a response knocking down each of Ethiopiaâ€™s arguments, noting that not even the U.S. government is allowed to do what Ethiopia claims it had the right to do here: wiretap Americans in America with no legal process whatsoever. We argue that Ethiopia must be held accountable for wiretapping Mr. Kidane, just as any other actor would be. Neither its status as a government nor the fact that it launched its attack on Mr. Kidane from Ethiopia gives it carte blanche to ignore the law. If Ethiopia legitimately needed to collect information about Americans for an investigation, it could negotiate a deal with the U.S., called a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, which would allow it to seek U.S. assistance for something like a wiretap. Otherwise, there simply is no â€œinternational spyingâ€ù exception to the law for foreign governments, nor should there be. When sovereign governments act, especially when they invade the privacy of ordinary people, they must do so within the bounds of the law. And when foreign governments break U.S. law, U.S. courts have the power to hold them accountable.This is the next step in what we hope will set an important precedent in the U.S., fighting back against the growing problem of state-sponsored malware. No matter what one thinks about the NSA spying on Americans inside the U.S. (of course EFF believes that this has gone way far too), it should be easy to see that foreign governmentsâ€”be they Ethiopia, China, or as EFF itself experienced Vietnamâ€”do not and should not have that right.","EFF to Ethiopia: Illegal Wiretapping Is Illegal, Even for Governments",https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/eff-ethiopia-illegal-wiretapping-illegal-even-governments,https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/08/eff-ethiopia-illegal-wiretapping-illegal-even-governments2017-02-14T15:29:07.368200,4.08%,44%,"Democrats Denounce Trump Immigration Order as UnconstitutionalBy Katherine Gypson January 31, 2017Congressional Democrats pushed back Tuesday against President Donald Trump, declaring his controversial executive order on immigration ""unconstitutional,"" just hours after he fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce the ban.""Several federal courts have already found that President Trump's order is very likely unconstitutional.Upcoming lawsuitsThe legality of the executive order will ultimately be tested in a longer-term battle fought in the courts.""The attorney general is the people's attorney, not the president's attorney,"" Leahy said.""But Democrats pointed to Yates' firing as further proof the executive order would not stand up in court because of numerous alleged violations of the Constitution.","Democrats Denounce Trump Immigration Order as UnconstitutionalBy Katherine Gypson January 31, 2017Congressional Democrats pushed back Tuesday against President Donald Trump, declaring his controversial executive order on immigration ""unconstitutional,"" just hours after he fired Acting Attorney General Sally Yates for refusing to enforce the ban.Democrats, already outraged by the order temporarily limiting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, hailed Yates as ""a patriot.""

Kelly had empowered federal authorities to more aggressively detain and deport illegal immigrants, the US media reported on Sunday.The order targets the immigrants already inside the United States as well as those arriving at the border, The Washington Post reported.Another media report claimed that the Trump administration was considering a proposal to mobilise as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up unauthorised immigrants.The White House, however, said it had no plans to use troops to deport immigrants and that the report was â€œ100 per cent not trueâ€ù. But the Associated Press, which released the second report, said it had a copy of the draft memo.â€œThe 11-page document calls for the unprecedented militarisation of immigration enforcement as far north as Portland, Oregon, and as far east as New Orleans, Louisiana,â€ù the news agency reported.The Washington Post, which also obtained a pair of memos, said the Trump administration planned to expand the pool of immigrants who were prioritised for removal, speed up deportation hearings and enlist local law-enforcement personnel to help make arrests.The administration also planned to hire thousands of additional enforcement officers. The new directives would supersede nearly all of those issued under previous administrations.A White House official told The Post that the memos were drafts and the process was not complete yet. It reported, however, that the memos were implementation blueprints for the Department of Homeland Security, formally establishing the new policies and directing agency employees to begin following them.Immigrant rights advocates told The Post that the two memos marked a major shift in US immigration policies by dramatically expanding the scope of enforcement operations. The new procedures would allow authorities to seek expedited deportation proceedings, currently limited to undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for two weeks or less, to anyone who has been in the country for up to two years.Another new provision is about immediately returning Mexican immigrants who are apprehended at the border back home, pending the outcomes of their deportation hearings, rather than housing them on US soil.The guidelines also aim to deter the arrival of a growing wave of 155,000 unaccompanied minors who have come from Mexico and Central America over the past three years. Under the new policies, their parents in the United States could be prosecuted if they are found to have paid smugglers to bring the children across the border.Published in Dawn, February 20th , 2017",Trump to expedite deportation of illegal immigrants,http://www.dawn.com/news/1315886/trump-to-expedite-deportation-of-illegal-immigrants,http://www.dawn.com/news/1315886/trump-to-expedite-deportation-of-illegal-immigrants2017-02-14T16:56:39.497741,4.35%,36%,"Following yesterdayâ€™s result that Donald Trump will become the next US president in January 2017, Andrea Elliot, CEO of Pro-Link GLOBAL , commented on the potential future of immigration in the USA.Any comments Trump has made have been highly inconsistent.To find out more about Pro-Link GLOBAL and Immigration Services, visit their Directory page.Between now and the inauguration in January, Pro-Link GLOBAL trust that cooler heads will prevail.For related news and features, visit our Immigration section.Overall, this would create a significant problem for global existing contracts, trade agreements and more.","Corporate immigrationBuild a physical wall between the United States and MexicoEnd the â€œcatch and releaseâ€ù protocol, so that illegal entrants into the United States would be detained until removed from the countryDeport criminal aliens, in joint operation with local, state and federal law enforcementTriple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agentsStop issuing visas in jurisdictions that are considered to have inadequate screening mechanismsEnd President Obamaâ€™s executive actions, DAPA and DACA, and deport beneficiaries of these programsEnd â€œsanctuary citiesâ€ù i.e. cities that avoid prosecutingTrump has called for a temporary ban on issuing visas to enter the United States from â€œvolatileâ€ù regions, but has not specified what these regions areGlobal visasAny national of a Muslim country would be subject to additional security clearances if entering on an existing visaIt could lead to an outright ban on visas for citizens of Muslim countriesThe reciprocity rule would be activatedWhat does it mean for US travellers?To find out more about Pro-Link GLOBAL and Immigration Services, visit their Directory page.For related news and features, visit our Immigration section.Following yesterdayâ€™s result that Donald Trump will become the next US president in January 2017, Andrea Elliot, CEO of Pro-Link GLOBAL , commented on the potential future of immigration in the USA.Any comments Trump has made have been highly inconsistent.

There would be three clear impacts of this ban:This would then have an immediate impact due to the universal principles of diplomatic reciprocity, essentially beginning a â€˜tit for tatâ€™ level of engagement.When the USA announced overnight it would charge a $100 entry fee to Brazilians, US citizens arriving in Rio de Janeiro faced the same fee on arrival to Brazil, plus the requirement of being photographed.Read moreA ban on Muslims or certain nationalities based on religion would likely lead to US citizens being barred from entering those countries. Overall, this would create a significant problem for global existing contracts, trade agreements and more. Multi-national corporations who trade in oil and petroleum products would be severely affected, as Middle Eastern nations would be likely to return the treatment.The Netherlands have experienced a similar situation after receiving a ban on work permit applications by Dutch passport holders in Saudi Arabia following a perceived slight against the Prophet.Commerce must and will continue for the benefit of the global economy but who represents the needs of global markets and business in Trumpâ€™s cabinet?

Some 166 founders, leaders and investors signed the diplomatic but unequivocal document.We the undersigned, founders and leaders of biotech companies, write to express our deep concern and opposition to the executive order signed by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017, barring the entry of citizens from seven countries into the United States.Some big names are on the list, including Alnylam, Biogen, Seattle Genetics and Bluebird Bio. On the venture capital side, Venrock, Third Rock, Flagship Pioneering and more also went on record.Conspicuously absent: Amgen and Celgene, the two biotech companies invited to the White House on January 31 to speak with the president. Gilead Sciences, the largest biotech in the business, was also MIA.At the time of publishing, Gilead had not responded to a request for comment.Two themes emerge in the letter. The first is the sentiment that the travel ban from seven countries feels like an affront against all immigrants.Though the ban from the Trump administration is aimed at seven countries, our global employees interpret the underlying message as, â€œAmerica is no longer welcoming of any immigrants, whatsoever.â€ù They fear similar orders could be issued for other countries at a momentâ€™s notice. They fear being stigmatized and discriminated against, simply because of their religion, irrespective of the nation they come from. Several among us have heard from employees about their deportation fears, how they do not feel comfortable leaving the country on business or how they now feel cut off from their family abroad.The second major theme is that immigrants, innovation and the biotech industry are inextricably tied. The letter cites a 2014 study, published in Nature, that found 52 percent of the 69,000 biomedical researchers in the United States were foreign-born.At a stroke, the new administration has compromised years of investment in this national treasure. Our colleagues who are here on visas or are in global outposts are now fearful and uncertain of their status. Scientists based in other countries and employed by our companies are afraid to come to the United States or are canceling trips. The parents and families of immigrants who live and work in the United States are reluctant to attempt to travel to and from the United States.President Trump signed the executive order on immigration on Friday, January 27, preventing citizens from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia from entering the United States.Leaders from many Fortune 500 companies immediately spoke out, but few biotech leaders were prepared to go on record.

It did not address the ultimate question of whether it could pass constitutional muster.The president has forcefully asserted all week that judges were wrong in their decisions on his order, and that immigration law gave him broad authority to restrict foreigners from entering the United States. He posted on Friday a quote from a Lawfare article, which noted the 9th Circuit judges had not cited in their opinion the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that gives him such powers.There seemed to be a growing view from commentators on the right, though, that the Trump administration might be better off to abandon this fight, rewrite portions the executive order, and be on more solid ground for future legal fights.Dan McLaughlin, a contributor to the National Review, urged the administration to â€œmoot and reboot.â€ùEdward Whelan, an influential voice in the conservative legal world who writes for the National Review Online, indicated on Twitter that he had doubts about the 9th Circuitâ€™s ruling, but also concerns about whether the Supreme Court would reinstate an executive order he viewed as flawed.He tweeted: â€œ2 modest propositions: (1) Courts are getting it wrong on EO; and (2) this is not the right legal battle to fight.

The court, they said, could permit travel for those â€œpreviously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future,â€ù but not, perhaps, for those without visas already.The judges rejected that argument, arguing that such relief would not help U.S. citizens who â€œhave an interest in specific non-citizensâ€™ ability to travel to the United States,â€ù nor would it allay concerns about the due process rights of people in the U.S. illegally.Justice Department lawyers also argued that the ban no longer applied to green-card holders - citing guidance from the White House counsel issued after the ban took effect - and challenges on those grounds should thus be invalidated.

Kelly signed new guidelines on Saturday giving federal authorities the power to more aggressively crack down on illegal immigration, marking what experts call a major shift in US immigration policies.Under the new guidelines, outlined in a pair of memos, the agency plans to hire thousands of additional enforcement agents, expand the pool of immigrants who are prioritized for removal, enlist local law enforcement to help make arrests, and speed up deportation hearings â€“ directives that would replace nearly all guidelines put in place by previous administrations.""The surge of immigration at the southern border has overwhelmed federal agencies and resources and has created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States,"" Secretary Kelly wrote, citing a surge of 10,000 to 15,000 additional apprehensions per month at the US-Mexico border between 2015 and 2016.Since taking office in January, President Trump has come under fire for what immigrant rights advocates have denounced as unprecedented action against undocumented people in the United States. In a series of executive orders last month, the president expanded the power of immigration officers and announced plans to fulfill his campaign promises by building a wall along the southern US border.Raids in early February, in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents (ICE) rounded up more than 680 people in nearly a dozen states, spurred widespread fear across immigrant communities.But the Trump administration's raids were actually smaller than similar sweeps under President Barack Obama, as The Christian Science Monitor's Harry Bruinius reported Tuesday. The Obama administrationâ€™s nationwide ""Cross Check"" operations apprehended more than 2,000 ""convicted criminal aliens who pose the greatest risk to our public safety"" in a similar five-day sweep in 2015.At the time, officials said that ICE had arrested a total of 13,214 people in a total of six raids, information that a Trump administration fact sheet reiterated this week. As Mr. Bruinius reported for the Monitor:By including this context in its fact sheets, and emphasizing that 75 percent of the immigrants detained last week had some kind of criminal conviction, the Trump administration emphasized continuity. After all, President Obama also prioritized the most dangerous undocumented criminals... Still, the enforcement actions created alarm in many communities â€“ even a sense of panic as word spread that ICE agents were showing up at homes and making targeted arrests. In one sense, the unease was disproportionate to the size of the operation. But many legal experts and immigration advocates note that Mr. Trumpâ€™s executive orders on immigration â€“ which call for the hiring of 10,000 additional immigration officers â€“ have fundamentally changed the agencyâ€™s previous priorities. That sets the stage for what could be a much wider-ranging routine of targeting undocumented immigrants for arrest.Defenders of Mr. Trump point to the Obama administration's record of having deported more people than any other White House in history, and argue that outrage over Trump's approach is hypocritical.""With Trump now residing in the White House and Republicans building their agenda in Congress, activists will turn their attention to the narrative,"" wrote Austin Yack for National Review on Friday. ""There is a new outpouring of articles on the deportation of illegal immigrants not because the press suddenly has a profound interest in the deportation of illegal immigrants, but because radicals who wish to erase our borders see an opportunity to demonize Trump and exploit his shortcomings for their agenda.""One significant change, immigrant rights activists note, is the Trump administration's definition of who is a ""criminal."" Trump's immigration order focuses not just on immigrants convicted of crimes, but anyone charged with an offense. Furthermore, it allows agents to arrest any person that an immigration officer perceives as posing a risk to either public safety or national security.With the new guidelines signed Saturday, the Trump administration would further distance itself from previous administrations on immigration policy. The new directives would allow authorities to seek expedited deportation proceedings, which are currently limited to undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for two weeks or less, to anyone who has been in the country for up to two years. They would also immediately return Mexican immigrants who are apprehended at the border back home pending the outcomes of their deportation hearings instead of housing them on US property.The memos also address the roughly 155,000 unaccompanied minors who have come from Mexico and Central America over the past three years. Under Kelly's guidelines, parents of these minors could be prosecuted if they are found to have paid smugglers to bring their children across the border.Immigrants rights advocates were quick to condemn the new policies.""[D]ue process, human decency, and common sense are treated as inconvenient obstacles on the path to mass deportation,"" said Joanne Lin, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement. ""The Trump administration is intent on inflicting cruelty on millions of immigrant families across the country.""In the memos, Kelly instructed agency chiefs to start hiring 10,000 additional ICE agents and 5,000 more for the Border Patrol, measures that were included in Trumpâ€™s executive actions last month. The DHS Secretary also expressed a desire to revive 287(g), a program introduced by former President Clinton that fell out of favor under the Obama administration, which would deputize local police to act as immigration officers for the purposes of enforcement. According to the memo, 32 jurisdictions in 16 states currently participate in the program.Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

During his campaign, Trump vowed to ""immediately terminate"" the program, but his stance appears to have softened since. Last week, he said he would ""show great heart"" in his approach.The memos are currently under review by the White House Counsel's Office, which is reportedly seeking some changes.",New Homeland Security guidelines aggressively crack down on illegal immigration,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2017/0219/New-Homeland-Security-guidelines-aggressively-crack-down-on-illegal-immigration,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2017/0219/New-Homeland-Security-guidelines-aggressively-crack-down-on-illegal-immigration2017-02-20T13:56:14.659168,4.89%,38%,"By Oladapo OkeowoThe Federal Government is looking favourably at exploring decriminalising and thereby, encouraging artisanal refineries in the Niger Delta.This was disclosed by Brigadier-General Paul Boroh (rtd), the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, in Yenagoa.Boroh went ahead to commend the tour of the region by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo which is to deliver the FGâ€™s intent regarding the Niger Delta.This is predicated on factors such as a need to meet the demand for refined petroleum products which such refineries have been helping do with over 50% of refined products used in the region, albeit illegally.â€œThe government is working with the oil-producing states, local governments, oil companies and the private sector, including civil society organisations to achieve sustainable development in Niger Delta,â€ù the amnesty coordinator revealed.","By Oladapo OkeowoThe Federal Government is looking favourably at exploring decriminalising and thereby, encouraging artisanal refineries in the Niger Delta.This is predicated on factors such as a need to meet the demand for refined petroleum products which such refineries have been helping do with over 50% of refined products used in the region, albeit illegally.So also is the effort seen as a sign of the governmentâ€™s desire to work with people of the Niger-Delta region as portrayed in the Acting Presidentâ€™s recent tour and other decisions that have come to light.This was disclosed by Brigadier-General Paul Boroh (rtd), the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta and Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, in Yenagoa.He said the FG intends the liberalisation of refineries to aid the development of the region as this move would have socio-economic benefits- job creation, income for the people, boosted local economy- for the communities.â€œThe government is working with the oil-producing states, local governments, oil companies and the private sector, including civil society organisations to achieve sustainable development in Niger Delta,â€ù the amnesty coordinator revealed.Boroh went ahead to commend the tour of the region by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo which is to deliver the FGâ€™s intent regarding the Niger Delta.He said: â€œThe planned oil-communities-intervention-meeting by the Federal Government to chart short, medium and long term development blueprint is a strategy to enhance the socio-economic activities in the region.â€ùHe called for patience and good behaviour on the part of the indigenes, especially the youth.",FG Mulls Authorising Illegal Refineries To Transform Niger Delta,http://www.concisenews.global/news/fg-mulls-authorising-illegal-refineries-to-transform-niger-delta/,http://www.concisenews.global/news/fg-mulls-authorising-illegal-refineries-to-transform-niger-delta/2016-12-28T14:16:30.973390,5.00%,20%,"The Traffickers premieres November 13 at 10 PM on Fusion.Having fled war-torn Afghanistan as a child, Nelufar set out to make a difference as a journalist.For The Traffickers host Nelufar Hedayat, exposing corruption is a personal mission.Her work focuses on cultural movements and conflicts affecting women, children, and families.","For The Traffickers host Nelufar Hedayat, exposing corruption is a personal mission.

But the Senate bill would direct the department to expand the photo program by offering grants to states if they allow the department to tap into their driverâ€™s license photo records, and also makes it clear that allowing such access would not represent a violation of a federal privacy law.Currently, only Mississippi allows the department into its motor vehicle database, Mr. Bentley said, and only for biographic information, like name and date of birth, not photographs.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it does not explicitly prohibit such a use, as the law governing the census does, critics said.In fact, privacy guidelines issued by the Homeland Security Department governing E-Verify say it may, on a case-by-case basis, â€œgive law enforcement agencies extracts of information on potential fraud, discrimination or other illegal activities.â€ùMr. Bentley said this provision was intended to prevent individual cases of wrongdoing, and not to allow broad searches of the data that are linked together by the E-Verify system.Mr. Conant said Senator Rubio would consider amendments to the legislation to address privacy concerns about the proposals.â€œGiven the justified concerns that many Americans have with the current administrationâ€™s overreach,â€ù Mr. Conant said in a statement, â€œwe are open to refinements that would further restrict the governmentâ€™s use of this technology, without undermining the ability of employers to ensure undocumented immigrants are not illegally obtaining employment.â€ù",Fears of National ID With Immigration Bill,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/us/politics/as-immigration-bill-moves-forward-fear-of-an-id-system.html,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/us/politics/as-immigration-bill-moves-forward-fear-of-an-id-system.html2017-02-20T20:56:11.176339,5.60%,47%,"Apparently, liberals have become so deranged that they now protest when the law enforcement officers they hire, such as Sheriff David Clarke, try to enforce the law.So, first the question â€“ â€˜Does Sheriff Clarke plan to take part in the Presidentâ€™s immigration enforcement program?â€™ Then the answer, â€˜Yes.â€™This simple response, clearly stating that, of course, the Sheriff would abide by the law, led to thousands of protesters marching on the streets in Wisconsin.I am obligated to protect people from criminal illegal aliens as I am from all criminal predators.President Trump made it clear with his Executive Order on enforcement of our immigration laws.Hereâ€™s what started the whole mess:AP reporter inquiry:Does Sheriff Clarke plan to enroll the sheriffâ€™s office into the portion of the 287G program in which local law enforcement officers will be deputized by the federal government to function as immigration officers, helping with investigations and the detention and apprehension of immigrants?","Apparently, liberals have become so deranged that they now protest when the law enforcement officers they hire, such as Sheriff David Clarke, try to enforce the law.

By what authority did Flynn act and to whom did he report?â€ù she asked.â€œThe FBI must accelerate its investigation of the Russian connection with the Trump Administration, and Congress must call for a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to fully investigate Russiaâ€™s influence on the Administration and the election,â€ù Pelosi said.Senator Mark Warner, Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said the American people deserve to know at whose direction Flynn was acting when he made these calls, and why the White House waited until these reports were public to take action.â€œThese developments underscore how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when,â€ù he said.â€œThis reinforces both the urgency and the significance of the Senate Intelligence Committeeâ€™s bipartisan investigation into Russian interference, which will include a thorough examination of contacts between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns, as well as interviews with current and former government officials,â€ù Warner said.Comments",Illegal leaks behind NSA Michael Flynnâ€™s resignation,http://watnopaarpunjabinews.com/illegal-leaks-behind-nsa-michael-flynns-resignation-donald-trump/,http://watnopaarpunjabinews.com/illegal-leaks-behind-nsa-michael-flynns-resignation-donald-trump/2017-02-13T14:41:30.661394,6.12%,42%,"Other cities just do not want to be forced into dealing with federal immigration policy.Some city councils pass ordinances declaring an intention to not enforce federal immigration policy.Many police departments rightly believe if they are forced to act as federal immigration agents, they compromise their relationships in the very communities federal officials need willing partners.But in 2017, Governor Christie is â€œreally willingâ€ù to partner with President Donald Trump in punishing municipalities that proclaim a willingness to aid undocumented people.Now the Trump administration â€“ and a willing Christie â€“ want walls.","Gov.

Trump initially called for a â€œtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going onâ€ù in December 2015 to widespread criticism. Successive campaign statements pared down that blanket ban on an entire religionâ€™s adherents to â€œextreme vettingâ€ù of Muslim individuals. A draft executive order published Wednesday by the Huffington Post didnâ€™t come close to fulfilling the original scope of the presidentâ€™s promises, but it still represented a sharp break from longstanding U.S. practices. If implemented, the Trump administrationâ€™s order would suspend the entire U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days while security measures are reviewed and ban Syrian refugees from U.S. entry indefinitely. It would also temporarily block entry visas from seven countriesâ€”Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libyaâ€”for 30 days as part of a broader security review of visa-admission programs, after which permanent visa bans could be enacted for those countries and others. The order also includes a variety of other security-related measures ranging from planning for safe zones in Syria and expediting biometric exit-entry screening for U.S. travelers.To understand the orderâ€™s scope and potential impact, I spoke with Jennifer Gordon, a Fordham University law professor who specializes in immigration law. Our conversation has been lightly edited for style and clarity. Matt Ford: If I'm a Syrian refugee in a camp in Turkey, what should I expect if this draft executive order becomes official? Jennifer Gordon: The current situation for Syrian refugees awaiting processing is that processing will come to a halt. There may be continued procedures within the camps, but as to admissions, the executive order stops them. There's also a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for everybody, and during that period, no refugees are going to be admitted unless there's a special exception made. Ford: How many refugees does the U.S. typically admit in a year? Gordon: That depends on the president's designation. The numbers vary in recent years, but President Obama last year designated the number at 110,000. This executive order cuts that number to 50,000. 50,000 admissions a year is the lowest number since the Refugee Act of 1980. It's never been lower than 70,000, including in the years following 9/11, so that is a historic low in this executive order. The numbers have hovered since 9/11 around 70,000 to 80,000 admissions. President Obama had increased the numbers, but this is not just a cut in those numbers, it's a cut that's far out of line with refugee admissions for the past 30-plus years.Ford: I noticed that there's also prioritization for refugees who face some sort of religious persecution after the 120-day period ends. Is that something that's unusual? Gordon: Congress has acted at times to give priority to particular groups of refugees who are religious minorities, so that's not unheard of. And some of those priorities are already in effect, but this seems broader than the ones that are already in place. Ford: Does Trump have the legal power to do what he's planning to do with this order under current U.S. law? Gordon: Current U.S. law gives a president the power, in consultation with Congress, to set numbers and geographic areas for refugee admissions, so this doesn't appear to be out of line with that. With regard to countries for which he's suspending the issuance of visas, there is a provision in the immigration laws that allows a president to make exactly such designations. The provision says that ""whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens, or the entry of any class of aliens, into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend...their entry."" So the question is would a challenge to that provision, particularly in the form that this was religious discrimination against majority-Muslim countries, would that stand? And that seems unlikely, given the legal standard under which the president's immigration actions are reviewed.Ford: What legal standard would that be? Gordon: So there's a doctrine called the plenary-power doctrine, it's been around for over 125 years, and it says that in particular in terms of who has a right to enter the United States, courts essentially do not review the president and Congress's actions for constitutionality. That's a very unusual carve-out. Thinking about Supreme Court decisions in this area, given that if I'm reading the executive order right, Trump has limited the exclusion to seven countries state sponsors of terrorism list and in the appropriations act, it's not a particularly close case. If he had listed a larger set of countries and all the countries were predominantly Muslim, there might be some challenge about discrimination on the basis of religion, but again, the courts really barely look at the Constitution when it comes to decisions about who will be admitted to the country. Ford: We saw that case in the Seventh Circuit last year shortly before the election where Indiana lost its bid to keep out Syrian refugees from the state. So it doesn't sound like there would be a chance for a similar victory for refugee groups in a similar case like this? Gordon: Just to be clear, we're talking about two different things. Section 3 of the executive order is not about refugees, it's about any kind of immigration: a tourist visa, a visa because you are from Iraq and you are married to a U.S. citizenâ€”all of those visas are suspended by this executive order. So that's a different area of law than refugee law. Refugee law is even clearer that the states have no power to set policy. That policy is entirely with the president and Congress.Ford: If I remember correctly the Seventh Circuit had blocked Indiana from implementing its plans to cut off funding on the basis it would discriminate on the basis of national origin, but from what it sounds like you're saying, a legal challenge against these programs hereâ€”either the refugee or the visa programâ€”would be unlikely to succeed? Gordon: That's my view, yes. As written in this executive order. Ford: Thereâ€™s some precedent for tinkering with classes of refugees. Are there any historical examples of presidents using this power to unilaterally exclude an entire class of people from visas? Gordon: It's certainly not unheard of. Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows presidents to suspend entry of â€œany class of aliensâ€ù when he finds that their admission ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump's executive order goes well beyond the actions contemporary presidents have taken under this provision, which have most often been limited to a particular category of people in a given foreign country. For example, President Obama forbade entry to individuals who had â€œfacilitated computer or network disruption that could assist in or enable serious human rights abuses by or on behalf of the government of Iran and Syria;â€ù President Bush barred supporters of the Mugabe government in Zimbabwe.

This executive order cuts that number to 50,000. 50,000 admissions a year is the lowest number since the Refugee Act of 1980. It's never been lower than 70,000, including in the years following 9/11, so that is a historic low in this executive order. The numbers have hovered since 9/11 around 70,000 to 80,000 admissions. President Obama had increased the numbers, but this is not just a cut in those numbers, it's a cut that's far out of line with refugee admissions for the past 30-plus years.Ford: I noticed that there's also prioritization for refugees who face some sort of religious persecution after the 120-day period ends. Is that something that's unusual? Gordon: Congress has acted at times to give priority to particular groups of refugees who are religious minorities, so that's not unheard of. And some of those priorities are already in effect, but this seems broader than the ones that are already in place. Ford: Does Trump have the legal power to do what he's planning to do with this order under current U.S. law? Gordon: Current U.S. law gives a president the power, in consultation with Congress, to set numbers and geographic areas for refugee admissions, so this doesn't appear to be out of line with that. With regard to countries for which he's suspending the issuance of visas, there is a provision in the immigration laws that allows a president to make exactly such designations. The provision says that ""whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens, or the entry of any class of aliens, into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend...their entry."" So the question is would a challenge to that provision, particularly in the form that this was religious discrimination against majority-Muslim countries, would that stand? And that seems unlikely, given the legal standard under which the president's immigration actions are reviewed.Ford: What legal standard would that be? Gordon: So there's a doctrine called the plenary-power doctrine, it's been around for over 125 years, and it says that in particular in terms of who has a right to enter the United States, courts essentially do not review the president and Congress's actions for constitutionality. That's a very unusual carve-out. Thinking about Supreme Court decisions in this area, given that if I'm reading the executive order right, Trump has limited the exclusion to seven countries state sponsors of terrorism list and in the appropriations act, it's not a particularly close case. If he had listed a larger set of countries and all the countries were predominantly Muslim, there might be some challenge about discrimination on the basis of religion, but again, the courts really barely look at the Constitution when it comes to decisions about who will be admitted to the country. Ford: We saw that case in the Seventh Circuit last year shortly before the election where Indiana lost its bid to keep out Syrian refugees from the state. So it doesn't sound like there would be a chance for a similar victory for refugee groups in a similar case like this? Gordon: Just to be clear, we're talking about two different things. Section 3 of the executive order is not about refugees, it's about any kind of immigration: a tourist visa, a visa because you are from Iraq and you are married to a U.S. citizenâ€”all of those visas are suspended by this executive order. So that's a different area of law than refugee law. Refugee law is even clearer that the states have no power to set policy. That policy is entirely with the president and Congress.Ford: If I remember correctly the Seventh Circuit had blocked Indiana from implementing its plans to cut off funding on the basis it would discriminate on the basis of national origin, but from what it sounds like you're saying, a legal challenge against these programs hereâ€”either the refugee or the visa programâ€”would be unlikely to succeed? Gordon: That's my view, yes. As written in this executive order. Ford: Thereâ€™s some precedent for tinkering with classes of refugees. Are there any historical examples of presidents using this power to unilaterally exclude an entire class of people from visas? Gordon: It's certainly not unheard of. Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act allows presidents to suspend entry of â€œany class of aliensâ€ù when he finds that their admission ""would be detrimental to the interests of the United States."" Trump's executive order goes well beyond the actions contemporary presidents have taken under this provision, which have most often been limited to a particular category of people in a given foreign country. For example, President Obama forbade entry to individuals who had â€œfacilitated computer or network disruption that could assist in or enable serious human rights abuses by or on behalf of the government of Iran and Syria;â€ù President Bush barred supporters of the Mugabe government in Zimbabwe.

Trump initially called for a â€œtotal and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going onâ€ù in December 2015 to widespread criticism. Successive campaign statements pared down that blanket ban on an entire religionâ€™s adherents to â€œextreme vettingâ€ù of Muslim individuals. A draft executive order published Wednesday by the Huffington Post didnâ€™t come close to fulfilling the original scope of the presidentâ€™s promises, but it still represented a sharp break from longstanding U.S. practices. If implemented, the Trump administrationâ€™s order would suspend the entire U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days while security measures are reviewed and ban Syrian refugees from U.S. entry indefinitely. It would also temporarily block entry visas from seven countriesâ€”Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libyaâ€”for 30 days as part of a broader security review of visa-admission programs, after which permanent visa bans could be enacted for those countries and others. The order also includes a variety of other security-related measures ranging from planning for safe zones in Syria and expediting biometric exit-entry screening for U.S. travelers.To understand the orderâ€™s scope and potential impact, I spoke with Jennifer Gordon, a Fordham University law professor who specializes in immigration law. Our conversation has been lightly edited for style and clarity. Matt Ford: If I'm a Syrian refugee in a camp in Turkey, what should I expect if this draft executive order becomes official? Jennifer Gordon: The current situation for Syrian refugees awaiting processing is that processing will come to a halt. There may be continued procedures within the camps, but as to admissions, the executive order stops them. There's also a 120-day suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for everybody, and during that period, no refugees are going to be admitted unless there's a special exception made.

What the judges did is take power away that belongs squarely in the hands of the president of the United States.""The issue is sure to come up when Trump meets Monday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said after the Republican leader issued his ban that America's northern neighbor welcomes with open arms ""those fleeing persecution, terror and war.""While the fate of Trump's restrictions on refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries plays out in the courts, a separate executive order prioritizing the deportation of undocumented migrants paved the way for the arrest of hundreds of people, many of them Latinos, this past week.As thousands of Mexicans protested Sunday against Trump's vow to make the country pay for his ""big, beautiful border wall,"" the White House confirmed the president's plans to weigh new action to speed up deportations of illegal immigrants.""As a result of the president's order, greatly expanded and more vigorous immigration enforcement activities are taking place,"" Miller said of the deportation decree.Earlier, Trump tweeted: ""The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise.

On his immigration stand, he acted on his second week in office, pushing forward on the immigration laws that haven't been enforced the last 20 to 30 years. It's surprising that so many people oppose the rule of law in our country.The executive order on scrutinizing immigrants who arrive from known extreme Islamic terrorist countries for at least the next 90 days is not an extreme demand. Many of those protesting aren't even American citizens.Those who had lived under Sharia law never were allowed to protest. I believe there are 46 countries that have Sharia law in place. People from countries that live under communist and fascist control have limited controlled protest.The reason Trump applied this executive order was to protect the American people from being harmed.Protests have merit that bring forth points that would benefit all of our country. It's hard to understand those who object to the rule of law. Our country is based on the guidance of our Constitution and the laws that govern us. Those laws have applied to all immigrants.Most of the people in the United States aren't interested in living under Sharia law or any other provision of any other system but the one we have in place now. Those who are dissatisfied with these laws could leave freely at any time.Sen. Joseph McCarthy tried to drain the swamp in the 1950s in Washington, D.C., and Hollywood. Maybe Trump can get it done.â€” Robert Dillon, San AngeloRead or Share this story: http://www.gosanangelo.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/02/14/immigration-order-makes-sense/97699484/",Immigration order makes sense,http://www.gosanangelo.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/02/14/immigration-order-makes-sense/97699484/,http://www.gosanangelo.com/story/opinion/readers/2017/02/14/immigration-order-makes-sense/97699484/2017-01-09T18:21:16.262384,6.96%,39%,"Hillary Clinton Thursday, October 20th, 2016 in a debate:Says Donald Trump used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower.We rated Trumpâ€™s statement Half True.A calculation by another group excluded employer contributions and came up with a total of $7 billion paid into the system by undocumented immigrants.In the case of Social Security and Medicare, it would be at least a decade â€” perhaps several â€” before they get any benefits.We rated Trumpâ€™s statement Mostly True.","Thereâ€™s just over a week left before the Nov. 8 election. So, in the time that remains, PolitiFact Georgia will be looking at how Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump have fared on fact-checks about major issues in the race for president of the United States.Today we look at their statements on immigration.Want to see how they fared? Abbreviated versions of our fact checks are below.Full versions can be found at www.politifact.com/georgia/.Want to comment on our rulings or suggest one of your own?

A new record could be reached in about seven years, according to Census Bureau estimates.Experts also say projections are based assuming future immigration exceeds current pace. At current levels, it may take longer.Trump didnâ€™t specify in how many years the record would be broken, but data points to a probable new record in fewer than 10 years.We rated Trumpâ€™s statement Mostly True.Donald Trump on Wednesday, October 19th, 2016 in the third 2016 presidential debate:Says Hillary Clinton â€œwanted the wall.â€ùThe Trump campaign cited Clintonâ€™s vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law by President George W. Bush, which authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the countryâ€™s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform.So itâ€™s fair to say Clinton supported a barrier. For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant â€” both block people.But the fence Clinton backed is not as extensive as the wall Trump is promoting. And in his phrasing, Trump equated the two.Clinton voted for 700 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, but not for the taller, longer concrete wall that he vows to build.The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context.We rated Trumpâ€™s statement Half True.Donald Trump on Wednesday, August 31st, 2016 in a speech:Says â€œHillary Clinton has pledged amnesty in her first 100 days, and her plan will provide Obamacare, Social Security, and Medicare for illegal immigrants, breaking the federal budget.â€ùHer plan doesnâ€™t â€œprovideâ€ù Obamacare, Social Security and Medicare to immigrants. Theyâ€™ll have to pay into the system to get those benefits just like everybody else.In the case of Social Security and Medicare, it would be at least a decade â€” perhaps several â€” before they get any benefits.In the case of Obamacare, even if all 11 million undocumented immigrants were so poor they qualified for Medicaid, it would not â€œbreakâ€ù the $4 trillion federal budget. But Clinton has said they would not automatically be eligible for Medicaid or subsidies.We rated Trumpâ€™s statement Mostly False.Hillary Clinton on Friday, August 5th, 2016 in remarks at journalistsâ€™ convention:Undocumented immigrants â€œpay $12 billion a year into Social Security.â€ùThe Social Security Administration estimates about $12 billion was paid into the administrationâ€™s trust funds from earnings of unauthorized workers in 2010 (after deducting about $1 billion from possible benefits paid out). This number includes contributions on behalf of employees as well as their employers. Workers and employers pony up about the same amount into the system.A calculation by another group excluded employer contributions and came up with a total of $7 billion paid into the system by undocumented immigrants.Clintonâ€™s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.We rated Clintonâ€™s statement Half True.",Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton and illegal immigration,http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/clinton-trump-ride-the-truth-meter-over-immigration-statements/E9JmI8FqQBg7EEydh3KT5M/,http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/clinton-trump-ride-the-truth-meter-over-immigration-statements/E9JmI8FqQBg7EEydh3KT5M/2017-02-20T16:28:07.632322,6.99%,42%,"But for Floridians, prescription drugs are increasingly a far more lethal habit.An analysis of autopsies in 2007 released this week by the Florida Medical Examiners Commission found that the rate of deaths caused by prescription drugs was three times the rate of deaths caused by all illicit drugs combined.Only last year, an accidental prescription drug overdose killed Anna Nicole Smith in Broward County.Cocaine, heroin and all methamphetamines caused 989 deaths, it found, while legal opioids â€” strong painkillers in brand-name drugs like Vicodin and OxyContin â€” caused 2,328.As a result, federal, state and local law enforcement officials say, Florida has become a source of prescription drugs that are illegally sold across the country.","MIAMI â€” From â€œScarfaceâ€ù to â€œMiami Vice,â€ù Floridaâ€™s drug problem has been portrayed as the story of a single narcotic: cocaine.

In addition he also mentioned the sprouting of people who are in the business of frying chips on pavements. He said such activities were a risk as they could cause fires in the CBD resulting in property being destroyed.According to the report, Clr Mangena said numerous complaints have been brought forward by shop owners over the increase in the number of maize roasting and use of gas fryers.â€œCouncil should therefore not ignore such a dangerous situation where maize is roasted everywhere in the city, all activities should be conducted on designated areas.

The acting Director of Housing and Community Services, Mr Mackenzie Moyo, however, told the meeting that there was no licence for maize roasting.According to the minutes, Chamber Secretary Mrs Sikhangele Zhou said although the city appreciated different projects and views but such activities should be carried out in a safe manner.

While campaigning, Trump criticized the program as an overreach of power that amounted to ""amnesty,"" but recently said he would make his decision with ""great heart.""The program grants 2-year work permits and deferred-removal status to immigrants without lawful status who arrived to the U.S. before their 16th birthdays. Applicants must meet education requirements, pass a criminal background check and have lived continuously in the country since June 2007. Participants, often called ""dreamers,"" are also eligible for driver's licenses.People who receive the status aren't granted citizenship -- so they can't vote -- or other lawful residency status. Instead, the exemption shields them from immediate removal through prosecutorial discretion. Because they're allowed to legally work, they must pay state and federal income taxes.The 15-year-old Little Rock girl came to the United States with her parents when she was 1 and moved to Arkansas when she was 2, she said.She does not remember the trip nor have memories of Mexico. Because she does not have legal status, she is unable to visit cousins, aunts and grandparents who remain in her home country, though she talks to them by phone a few times each month.A high school student who plays soccer and dances tap and ballet, the girl hopes to attend college and law school.""It's hard,"" living in the U.S. without legal status, the girl said. ""It's harder to get a job for me because I don't have DACA. ... I can't go to Mexico and visit my family, get to know them and come back.""More than 750,000 people have received deferred status since 2012, including 4,998 in Arkansas, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data.The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimates that 12,000 people in Arkansas are currently eligible for deferred status and an additional 1,000 would age into eligibility.Applicants file for deferred status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement handles most interior U.S. immigration-law enforcement. Both agencies are under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Trump could direct that Homeland Security continue the program in full, dismantle it immediately or stop granting future deferred status, which may prevent those currently with deferred status from renewing as required every two years.Teenagers who have received deferred status said it allowed them to take control of their lives.Jesus Fabian, a 17-year-old Parkview Arts and Science Magnet High School student, drives to his job at David's Burgers, where he works about 25 hours per week in the kitchen, he said.Fabian arrived to the U.S. from Mexico as a 5-year-old and has lived in Little Rock since shortly after his arrival, he said.Fabian, a member of his school's robotics team, said he is saving money to attend Pulaski Tech to complete basic college courses. He ultimately wants to pursue a bachelor's degree and a career in software development, he said.Fabian received deferred status nearly two years ago. It is scheduled to expire in December without a renewal.Asked about his expectation for how Trump would approach the program, Fabian said, ""He might change is mind."" If not, he said, ""My thoughts of chasing the American dream will be burst.""During an interview with ABC News broadcast Jan. 25, Trump said that so-called dreamers shouldn't worry.""They shouldn't be very worried,"" Trump said, according to a transcript of the interview. ""They are here illegally. They shouldn't be very worried. I do have a big heart. We're going to take care of everybody. We're going to have a very strong border.""Anchor David Muir specifically asked whether immigrants with deferred status would be ""allowed to stay.""""I'm going to tell you over the next four weeks,"" Trump said. ""But I will tell you, we're looking at this, the whole immigration situation, we're looking at it with great heart.""Some Republicans, including Trump, have long characterized the deferred-status program as ""amnesty,"" or a pardon for people who broke immigration laws.""President Obama's executive amnesty was an overreach of his Constitutional powers,"" U.S. Sen. John Boozman said in an emailed statement. ""The president does not have the authority to pick and choose what laws get enforced in the name of 'reform.'""Spokesmen for U.S. Reps. Bruce Westerman and Steve Womack didn't directly speak to the program when asked about it by email, and the other three members of Arkansas' congressional delegation -- Sen. Tom Cotton and Reps. Rick Crawford and French Hill -- did not respond to a request asking what they want to see happen with the program.Mireya Reith, executive director of Arkansas United Community Coalition, an advocacy group that works directly with immigrants on several issues, said she is advising all people who would be first-time applicants for deferred status to confer with legal experts.""For new applications, we are definitely very strongly suggesting -- whether it's going through us, an attorney or whomever -- that individuals don't apply independently, on their own,"" Reith said.Northwest Arkansas immigration attorney Drew Devenport said his office is discussing ""the risk versus potential rewards"" with would-be applicants.Devenport said he has filed four first-time applications since Trump's election. He said he has a list of another 13 children who are eligible for deferred status under the program but have not yet applied because of the program's uncertainty.""I honestly can't envision a scenario where the information obtained by the government through the DACA program would be used to target the children,"" Devenport said. ""You're going to see large public outcry attacking that policy.""Little Rock immigration attorney Cristina Monterrey said she's finding it difficult to provide advice to potential deferred-status applicants.""On the one hand, I don't want you to apply, because you're putting yourself out there,"" Monterrey said of the dilemma. ""We're forcing people to fly under the radar. That's not what we want. On the other hand, if you don't apply, you're still in violation without any protection. It puts immigration attorneys in a really hard position.""Maria Meneses, a 19-year-old Parkview graduate, arrived to the United States when she was 2 years old. She first received deferred status four years ago and recently renewed it for the third time, she said. Meneses also has a pending request for permanent residency status, or a green card, through her father, also a green-card holder.Meneses, who said she graduated high school with a 3.9 grade-point average, is a biology pre-med student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.""My mother, she inspired me,"" Meneses said. ""She was a doctor and she was the first one to graduate from her family. She went through poverty. She's really had to hustle for what she wanted.""Meneses said she wants to be a pediatrician, a family doctor or, maybe, a politician.""I have been shifting my views slightly on getting involved in politics,"" Meneses said. ""It kind of angers me that [elected officials] say so many bad things about us, but do they really go out there into the community? And do they really look at us and see how much we work and contribute back to this country? I just want justice. I want equality.""Meneses said she's not talking about local politics: ""Maybe, like governoress of Arkansas.""Meneses visited her home country of Guatemala for the first time in 2014. Because of her deferred status, she was allowed leave the country for a predetermined time -- and later return -- in order to go to see an ill family member.""It was my first memories of Guatemala because the last time I was there, I was only 2 years old, and before that I didn't have a memory,"" Meneses said.

He said he has a list of another 13 children who are eligible for deferred status under the program but have not yet applied because of the program's uncertainty.""I honestly can't envision a scenario where the information obtained by the government through the DACA program would be used to target the children,"" Devenport said. ""You're going to see large public outcry attacking that policy.""Little Rock immigration attorney Cristina Monterrey said she's finding it difficult to provide advice to potential deferred-status applicants.""On the one hand, I don't want you to apply, because you're putting yourself out there,"" Monterrey said of the dilemma. ""We're forcing people to fly under the radar. That's not what we want. On the other hand, if you don't apply, you're still in violation without any protection. It puts immigration attorneys in a really hard position.""Maria Meneses, a 19-year-old Parkview graduate, arrived to the United States when she was 2 years old. She first received deferred status four years ago and recently renewed it for the third time, she said. Meneses also has a pending request for permanent residency status, or a green card, through her father, also a green-card holder.Meneses, who said she graduated high school with a 3.9 grade-point average, is a biology pre-med student at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.""My mother, she inspired me,"" Meneses said. ""She was a doctor and she was the first one to graduate from her family. She went through poverty. She's really had to hustle for what she wanted.""Meneses said she wants to be a pediatrician, a family doctor or, maybe, a politician.""I have been shifting my views slightly on getting involved in politics,"" Meneses said. ""It kind of angers me that [elected officials] say so many bad things about us, but do they really go out there into the community? And do they really look at us and see how much we work and contribute back to this country? I just want justice. I want equality.""Meneses said she's not talking about local politics: ""Maybe, like governoress of Arkansas.""Meneses visited her home country of Guatemala for the first time in 2014. Because of her deferred status, she was allowed leave the country for a predetermined time -- and later return -- in order to go to see an ill family member.""It was my first memories of Guatemala because the last time I was there, I was only 2 years old, and before that I didn't have a memory,"" Meneses said. ""It was as if I was going somewhere new.""A Section on 02/13/2017",Immigration shift tense for 'dreamers' deferred,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/feb/13/immigration-shift-tense-for-dreamers-de/,http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/feb/13/immigration-shift-tense-for-dreamers-de/2017-02-15T08:55:45.659832,7.78%,45%,"It has certainly changed for US Judge James L.

In a short span of time, the president signed executive orders calling for the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and a crackdown on so-called â€œsanctuary cities,â€ù which limit collaboration between local authorities and federal immigration agents. The orders fell in line with Trumpâ€™s repeated pledge to control illegal immigration in the United States and suggested that Trump will likely pursue an immigration agenda that resembles the aggressive deportations of former President Obamaâ€™s first term. The Obama administration deported record numbers of undocumented immigrants, much to the frustration of immigrant advocates. In his first term alone, he deported 1.5 million undocumented immigrants. By the end of his tenure, Obama had deported more people than his most recent predecessors, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, though the number of deportations dipped after his second term. There was also a corresponding push for legalization under the Obama administrationâ€”and that push is absent from Trumpâ€™s order. Latest from Politics Federal Judges Refuse to Reinstate Trump's Immigration Ban Obamaâ€™s successor has already put forth new, more stringent criteria for deportation. With the establishment of a new deportation program in 2014, the Obama administration sought to prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants who broke the law over those who did not. That year, the Department of Homeland Security created the Priority Enforcement Program, which focused on undocumented immigrants who posed a threat to â€œnational security, border security, and public safety.â€ù â€œThe intent of this new policy is to provide clearer and more effective guidance in the pursuit of those priorities,â€ù wrote then-Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson in a 2014 memo.The Obama administrationâ€™s new approach meant scrapping the Secure Communities Program, in which local law enforcement shared digital fingerprints of people booked into jail with federal authorities, who would then determine whether an individual was in the country illegally and whether to pursue deportation. The program originated in the George W. Bush administration and had received backlash from city officials, who said it was driving a wedge between law enforcement and the communities they police. â€œIts very name has become a symbol for general hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws,â€ù Johnson wrote in a 2014 memo. The executive order signed by Trump last week, dubbed â€œEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,â€ù adopted a priority system that is far broader than the previous administrationâ€™s after 2014. Trumpâ€™s order specifically names â€œaliens who have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.â€ùThe language used in the order suggests that an individual does not need to be convicted of a crime to be considered for removal. That goes further than the Obama administrationâ€™s 2014 directive, which explicitly noted that to be considered a priority for deportation, an undocumented immigrant must be convicted of an offense. â€œThe enforcement priorities are much more loose,â€ù said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank focused on immigration. â€œ[Trump] is casting a wider net.â€ù The Trump administration also intends to reinstate the Secure Communities Program, despite the friction it caused between local authorities and the communities they protect. Clarissa MartÃ_nez De Castro, the deputy vice president of the Office of Research, Advocacy, and Legislation at National Council of La Raza, said Trumpâ€™s revival of the programâ€”and the broad language used in listing prioritiesâ€”indicates that he has a different perspective from that of his predecessor. â€œWhen the executive orders that you are putting on the table are predicated aggressively on misinformation or outright lies about the immigrant community, I think thereâ€™s a huge gap,â€ù she said. â€œObamaâ€™s stated goal was to reform the system, bring people out of the shadows, put them on a path to citizenship, so it didnâ€™t make sense to advocates that he was pursuing Secure Communities,â€ù as well as another federal program that involved local authorities, Appleby said.Also included in the executive order are measures to penalize â€œsanctuary cities,â€ù or jurisdictions that adopt policies to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation.

The orders fell in line with Trumpâ€™s repeated pledge to control illegal immigration in the United States and suggested that Trump will likely pursue an immigration agenda that resembles the aggressive deportations of former President Obamaâ€™s first term. The Obama administration deported record numbers of undocumented immigrants, much to the frustration of immigrant advocates. In his first term alone, he deported 1.5 million undocumented immigrants.

There was also a corresponding push for legalization under the Obama administrationâ€”and that push is absent from Trumpâ€™s order. Latest from Politics Federal Judges Refuse to Reinstate Trump's Immigration Ban Obamaâ€™s successor has already put forth new, more stringent criteria for deportation. With the establishment of a new deportation program in 2014, the Obama administration sought to prioritize deporting undocumented immigrants who broke the law over those who did not. That year, the Department of Homeland Security created the Priority Enforcement Program, which focused on undocumented immigrants who posed a threat to â€œnational security, border security, and public safety.â€ù â€œThe intent of this new policy is to provide clearer and more effective guidance in the pursuit of those priorities,â€ù wrote then-Department of Homeland Secretary Jeh Johnson in a 2014 memo.The Obama administrationâ€™s new approach meant scrapping the Secure Communities Program, in which local law enforcement shared digital fingerprints of people booked into jail with federal authorities, who would then determine whether an individual was in the country illegally and whether to pursue deportation. The program originated in the George W. Bush administration and had received backlash from city officials, who said it was driving a wedge between law enforcement and the communities they police. â€œIts very name has become a symbol for general hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws,â€ù Johnson wrote in a 2014 memo. The executive order signed by Trump last week, dubbed â€œEnhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,â€ù adopted a priority system that is far broader than the previous administrationâ€™s after 2014. Trumpâ€™s order specifically names â€œaliens who have been convicted of any criminal offense; have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or in the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.â€ùThe language used in the order suggests that an individual does not need to be convicted of a crime to be considered for removal. That goes further than the Obama administrationâ€™s 2014 directive, which explicitly noted that to be considered a priority for deportation, an undocumented immigrant must be convicted of an offense. â€œThe enforcement priorities are much more loose,â€ù said Kevin Appleby, the senior director of international migration policy at the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank focused on immigration. â€œ[Trump] is casting a wider net.â€ù The Trump administration also intends to reinstate the Secure Communities Program, despite the friction it caused between local authorities and the communities they protect.

And the Trump administrationâ€™s attempt last week to have the ban lifted was denied.Miller on Sunday argued the appeal court has overstepped its authority, reasserting the presidentâ€™s powers and expressing confidence that Trump will prevail in his promise to stop radical Islamic terrorists from entering the United States.â€œThe three judges made a broad, over-reaching statement,â€ù Miller said. â€œThe presidentâ€™s powers here are beyond question. â€_ Something good is going to come out of this. The powers of the president will be confirmed.â€ùIn response to assertions that the executive orders were hastily crafted and executed, Miller argued they were drafted by â€œcongressional expertsâ€ù and reviewed by lawyers and top federal agency officials.He also argued that the three executive orders on immigration signed last month essentially remain in effect and that they have already â€œprofoundly improved our national security.â€ùMiller also said that Assistant to the President Steve Bannon, who is considered a driving force behind Trumpâ€™s immigration policies, had â€œno roleâ€ù in the so-called roll out of the executive orders, which immediately created problems for travelers, including those with green cards, arriving at U.S. airports.",Trump adviser Miller says new executive orders on illegal immigration an 'option',http://foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/12/trump-adviser-miller-says-new-executive-orders-on-illegal-immigration-option.html,http://foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/12/trump-adviser-miller-says-new-executive-orders-on-illegal-immigration-option.html2017-01-09T18:19:52.002104,8.39%,39%,"We rate Clintonâ€™s statement Half True.We rate Clintonâ€™s claim Mostly True.We rate Clintonâ€™s claim Half True.But those non-partisan fact-checkers from PolitiFact are still on the job, trying to parse political truth from political fiction.Donald Trump:â€œHeroin .. pours across our southern borders.â€ùMexican heroin accounted for 45 percent of the total weight of heroin the DEA seized and analyzed in 2012 (South American heroin accounted for 51 percent).","The final Clinton-Trump debate is history.But those non-partisan fact-checkers from PolitiFact are still on the job, trying to parse political truth from political fiction.Want to see how they fared?

(INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109 367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nationâ€™s immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nationâ€™s southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nationâ€™s southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individualsâ€™ claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) â€œAsylum officerâ€ù has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).(b) â€œSouthern borderâ€ù shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.(c) â€œBorder Statesâ€ù shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.(d) Except as otherwise noted, â€œthe Secretaryâ€ù shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.(e) â€œWallâ€ù shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.(f) â€œExecutive departmentâ€ù shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.(g) â€œRegulationsâ€ù shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.(h) â€œOperational controlâ€ù shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as â€œcatch and release,â€ù whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid. Within 30 days of the date of this order, the head of each executive department and agency shall submit this information to the Secretary of State. Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.(e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.Sec. 12. Authorization to Enter Federal Lands. The Secretary, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior and any other heads of agencies as necessary, shall take all appropriate action to:(a) permit all officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to have access to all Federal lands as necessary and appropriate to implement this order; and(b) enable those officers and employees of the United States, as well as all State and local officers as authorized by the Secretary, to perform such actions on Federal lands as the Secretary deems necessary and appropriate to implement this order.Sec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate steps to establish prosecution guidelines and allocate appropriate resources to ensure that Federal prosecutors accord a high priority to prosecutions of offenses having a nexus to the southern border.Sec. 14. Government Transparency. The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended at or near the southern border using a uniform method of reporting by all Department of Homeland Security components, in a format that is easily understandable by the public.Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary, within 90 days of the date of this order, and the Attorney General, within 180 days, shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order.Sec. 16. Hiring. The Office of Personnel Management shall take appropriate action as may be necessary to facilitate hiring personnel to implement this order.Sec. 17. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

To target those few countries, none of which were home to any terrorist attacks in this country, while excluding, for instance, Saudi Arabia, the most egregious supporter of radical Islamic networks, is not only discriminatory, but also raises questions about how Trump's business associations skew his decisions.The order continued the efforts of the Trump campaign to demonize all Muslims, in spite of their being the majority of ISISâ€™ victims. This blatant attempt to stir up prejudice against Muslims is a violation of one of the basic rights of this nation, our freedom of religion.We decry the administration's attempt to divide American citizens against each other and to foment irrational fear of refugees, who have endured unspeakable violence and seek only to save their lives, and especially the lives of their children.

The forum was co-sponsored by the Rockland Immigration Coalition, Helping Hands of Rockland County, Palisades Presbyterian Church and Nauraushaun Presbyterian Church, and supported by a grant from the Hudson River Presbytery.Almost 150 Rockland residents gathered to learn about the New Sanctuary Movement, a nationwide initiative through which support and accompaniment are provided for families who are threatened with separation through deportation. Sanctuary is not merely the action of a single congregation, but the work of a community. During the forum, two expert panels led discussions about the history and practice of sanctuary, as well as the importance of knowing the constitutional rights of those within the United States.The attendees were Muslim and Jew, Christian and secular, of every age and race. They learned from an attorney, a staff person from the New York Immigration Coalition, a sanctuary practitioner, a rabbi and a Presbyterian minister. All were encouraged, as people of conscience, by the crowd who showed up on the Monday morning after the Super Bowl, as well as by the depth of their concern.Since the forum, there have been raids all over the country, including one in Hudson, New York, where four people were detained. The urgency of this situation is not something that our communities can overlook. Rockland County is organizing to respond.Gail K.

This is not for the first time it has grabbed media headlines in the country. In the late 1990s it was a hot topic among both the Conservatives and the Labour Party. But it snowballed into a major contentious issue in 2013 when the countryâ€™s Home Office department handed out a jarring note on problems caused by immigration.In its report, prepared after conducting a survey of local authorities and service providers in the country, the Home Office department said: â€œWhile we have always recognized and believed in the benefits of immigration, uncontrolled immigration causes a number of problems for the United Kingdom.â€ù The report, uncharacteristically bold in its contention, further said that asylum seekers, refugees and low-skilled immigrants are creating overcrowding and fueling community tensions in the country. In 2015, it was one of the top subjects of the parliamentary election. Since then, the issue has become flagrant. Tory parliamentarians, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are now pressurizing the David Cameron government to adopt an Australian-style points system to resolve the problem of immigration in the country. Their stand is that by 2020 the UK should mark an end to the current situation where workers from rest of 27 European Union countries have an automatic right to work in Britain.What is Australian-style points system?Australian immigration policy is strict. To qualify for visas here, an applicant must be under 50; any individual aged between 25 and 32 automatically gets 30 of the required 60 points following an application for visa, but one aged between 45 and 49 starts with zero point when applying for visa to Australia; an applicant must have a basic knowledge of English, but he or she would be rewarded points only when his or her language skills are found out to be â€œproficientâ€ù or â€œsuperior.â€ùCertain qualifications from Australia also help in securing points. For example, a doctorate from an institution recognized by Australia is worth 20 points. If a visa seeker has previously worked in Australia or if he has studied in specific parts of the country like metropolitan cities with low population growth, he or she has chances of earning certain points. In the case of visas for certain jobs in Australia, sponsorship by an employer or family member or nomination by a government is required. Skilled worker is required to earn minimum 65 points to get Australian visa. But professionals like accountants and mechanics are required to earn 60 points, while manual workers and interior decorators are required to get minimum 40 points to get visa. However, before applying for visa, one must have to submit health certificate containing details of his or her health conditions. It is also mandatory for visa seekers to submit character certificate. Nonetheless, in 1989, the points system was first time launched in Australia. Since then it has gone through several modifications and last change introduced into it was in July 2011.Does Britain have a points-based immigration system?In 2008, points-based immigration system was launched in the UK. But this system is for people coming to work in the country from outside the European Union. Through this route people from India, Pakistan and non-European countries enter Britain and visa is provided to an applicant who is either highly skilled or is a high-net-worth investor or possess exceptional talent. Sometime those jobs which cannot be fulfilled within the UK are filled through skilled immigrant workers. Foreign students seeking enrollment in colleges and universities in the UK are also given visas through this route. English language ability, age and previous experiences matter in earning points for visas to the UK. The key objective behind introducing point-based system was to increase immigration and to make the right people permanent residents of the country.Why leave EU campaigners seek stringent visa regime?Leave campaigners want point-based system to also cover migrants from the European Union who enter the UK without any check and take up jobs, including low-paid manual works there. In 2015, as per an estimate, over 300,000 people migrated from the European Union countries to the UK. Romania, Poland, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria were last years top five European Union countries which contributed heavily to the migration of people to the UK. In the last five years, according to a data, the rate of immigration to the UK from the European Union nations has increased by 51 percent. In view of this, pro-Brexit campaigners want the country to put an end to free entry of people to the UK from Europe. They want migrants to be admitted on the basis of their skills and that they should be suitable for relevant jobs in the country. And then, those who come must have the ability to speak good English. These campaigners also seek amendment of the 1972 European Committee Act to remove criminals and others whose presence in the UK is detrimental to the public. However, before this could happen they want strict immigration norms in their country which is already home to 3.36 million migrants.There is fear among residents of the UK that a further arrival of migrants would impact the countryâ€™s health, education, job, housing and other sectors. They also fear that unchecked flow of people from the European Union may damage social, economic and political cohesion existing in the British society. Their apprehension has been further compounded by a leaked British government report which says that mass migration is impacting social cohesion, with highly qualified migrants taking low-skilled jobs from British nationals. A dramatic rise in the number of children from European migrantsâ€™ families has also put a strain on the countryâ€™s education system. It is said that almost 700,000 school going children have a parent who is a citizen of another European nation. Since 2007, this number has doubled. Britain, as per an estimate, requires 27 average-sized secondary schools or 100 primary schools to meet the rising demand for places of education for children in the country.Similar is the situation in the housing sector. It is said that if migrants are not stopped from flooding the UK, there would be acute shortage of dwelling blocks in the country. If UK Statistics Authority is to be believed, in between 2006 and 2014 more than 1.6 million people moved to the UK from within Europe. That means in nine years an average of 500 people from the EU moved to Britain per day to settle down there. British authorities say they canâ€™t refuse entry to people who are holding EU passports. This situation needs to be urgently addressed say pro-Brexit campaigners. According to Migration Watch, a Britain-based immigration and asylum research organization and think-tank, the UK population is heading for 70 million in twenty years and 68 per cent of the rise in it will be due to immigration. It further says that since 1997, as many as 75 per cent of jobs generated went to foreign born workers. To accommodate large flow of migrants, as per this non-profit think tank, the UK will be required to build 330 new homes everyday for the next 23 years. These reports have charged up the atmosphere in the UK with large number of people coming out in support of leave campaigners. But question is: Can Britain restrict flow of migrants? If so what would be its allies and partnersâ€™ reaction.",Immigration: A major headache for the UK,http://blog.mapsofworld.com/2016/06/07/immigration-a-major-headache-for-uk/#respond,http://blog.mapsofworld.com/2016/06/07/immigration-a-major-headache-for-uk/#respond2017-01-06T02:24:09.439086,9.79%,33%,"In 2008, points-based immigration system was launched in the UK.In the last five years, according to a data, the rate of immigration to the UK from the European Union nations has increased by 51 percent.In 2015, as per an estimate, over 300,000 people migrated from the European Union countries to the UK.Does Britain have a points-based immigration system?Romania, Poland, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria were last years top five European Union countries which contributed heavily to the migration of people to the UK.","As the June 23 referendum on â€˜Brexitâ€™ is approaching, debates in the United Kingdom over immigration are getting forceful with â€˜leave European Unionâ€™ campaigners sparing no efforts to convince voters that their countryâ€™s interest would be better served if the issue is resolved once and for all. This is not for the first time it has grabbed media headlines in the country. In the late 1990s it was a hot topic among both the Conservatives and the Labour Party. But it snowballed into a major contentious issue in 2013 when the countryâ€™s Home Office department handed out a jarring note on problems caused by immigration.In its report, prepared after conducting a survey of local authorities and service providers in the country, the Home Office department said: â€œWhile we have always recognized and believed in the benefits of immigration, uncontrolled immigration causes a number of problems for the United Kingdom.â€ù The report, uncharacteristically bold in its contention, further said that asylum seekers, refugees and low-skilled immigrants are creating overcrowding and fueling community tensions in the country. In 2015, it was one of the top subjects of the parliamentary election. Since then, the issue has become flagrant. Tory parliamentarians, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are now pressurizing the David Cameron government to adopt an Australian-style points system to resolve the problem of immigration in the country. Their stand is that by 2020 the UK should mark an end to the current situation where workers from rest of 27 European Union countries have an automatic right to work in Britain.What is Australian-style points system?Australian immigration policy is strict. To qualify for visas here, an applicant must be under 50; any individual aged between 25 and 32 automatically gets 30 of the required 60 points following an application for visa, but one aged between 45 and 49 starts with zero point when applying for visa to Australia; an applicant must have a basic knowledge of English, but he or she would be rewarded points only when his or her language skills are found out to be â€œproficientâ€ù or â€œsuperior.â€ùCertain qualifications from Australia also help in securing points. For example, a doctorate from an institution recognized by Australia is worth 20 points. If a visa seeker has previously worked in Australia or if he has studied in specific parts of the country like metropolitan cities with low population growth, he or she has chances of earning certain points. In the case of visas for certain jobs in Australia, sponsorship by an employer or family member or nomination by a government is required.

The prayers, in Bormuth's words, are literally 'government speech,'"" said judges Karen Nelson Moore and Jane Branstetter Stranch.They said the exclusion of non-Christian prayers puts Christianity ""in a privileged position"" and ""advances one faith over others.""The court reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Marianne Battani in Detroit, who said Bormuth was being ""hypersensitive.""""I'm very pleased. I can't wait to read the decision,"" said Bormuth, 61, a non-lawyer who has represented himself during more than three years of litigation. ""One of the greatest gifts we were given by our Founding Fathers was the separation of church and state and religious freedom.""In his lawsuit, Bormuth, a pagan, said he felt compelled to stand and participate in religion in order to speak to elected officials at meetings. He believes his criticism likely cost him appointments on a county solid waste committee and a public works board.James ""Steve"" Shotwell Jr., chairman of the county board, declined to comment on the decision. County Administrator Mike Overton said an invocation is offered at monthly meetings.""Each commissioner does whatever they feel is appropriate,"" he said. ""I haven't seen anything other than a Christian prayer or a moment of silence. We aren't trying to proselytize or anything like that.""In dissent, Judge Richard Griffin said the court's majority opinion misapplied U.S. Supreme Court decisions on public prayer. He also said Jackson County commissioners are not required to give people of other faiths an opportunity for an invocation.___Follow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap",Court says Jackson County Christian-only prayer is illegal,http://foxnews.com/us/2017/02/15/court-says-jackson-county-christian-only-prayer-is-illegal0.html,http://foxnews.com/us/2017/02/15/court-says-jackson-county-christian-only-prayer-is-illegal0.html2017-02-15T14:51:50.245742,11.02%,34%,"â€œBecause of President Trumpâ€™s order, we are expecting fewer refugees in the coming months,â€ù Thielman said.Fifteen Dartmouth students, scholars and staff are nationals of Iran or Iraq, two of the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in Trumpâ€™s order.Dartmouth College and 16 other top-ranked universities have filed a legal brief opposing President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration order, claiming that hardships created by the order harm their academic mission.On Thursday, the International Institute is hosting a meet and greet session where potential volunteers will meet refugee families.Last Friday, the organization resettled a family from the south Asian country of Bhutan, the only family it has settled in New Hampshire since a judge temporarily blocked much of Trumpâ€™s order.","Dartmouth College and 16 other top-ranked universities have filed a legal brief opposing President Donald Trumpâ€™s immigration order, claiming that hardships created by the order harm their academic mission.In doing so, the institutions join a flood of others â€” state attorneys general, religious groups, individuals and civil rights groups â€” going to court to challenge Trumpâ€™s restrictions on refugee resettlement.Meanwhile in Manchester, a refugee resettlement organization is preparing to welcome a family of eight from Afghanistan. The family is arriving on a special immigrant visa because one of the family members translated for the U.S. military, said Jeffrey Thielman, executive director for the International Institute of New England.Thielman said the Afghan family has been vetted and is scheduled to arrive Feb. 22. Last Friday, the organization resettled a family from the south Asian country of Bhutan, the only family it has settled in New Hampshire since a judge temporarily blocked much of Trumpâ€™s order.Manchester also appears ready to embrace the arrivals.On Thursday, the International Institute is hosting a meet and greet session where potential volunteers will meet refugee families.The event is at capacity â€” 200 people â€” and will be held at the Manchester Historic Association Millyard Museum.Manchester resident Bill Gillett, the president of the International Institute, said volunteers do everything from collecting donations to helping new arrivals with their English.â€œWe are trying to develop a better volunteer approach to what we do,â€ù Gillett said. Canada, he said, actually pairs refugees with a host family. He said monthly meet and greet sessions, which had been held at the International Institute office in Manchester, have been at capacity since Trump was elected President.Collegesâ€™ caseThe Dartmouth legal brief was filed in federal court in New York on Monday.Also signing onto the friend-of-the-court brief were Brown, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Duke, Emory, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Northwestern, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Stanford, Vanderbilt and Yale.It was filed in the case of Darweesh v. Trump.â€œSafety and security concerns can be addressed in a manner that is consistent with the values America has always stood for, including the free flow of ideas and people across borders and the welcoming of immigrants to our universities,â€ù the brief reads.The brief said that the universities derive immeasurable benefit from students, faculty and scholars from across the world, and the executive order threatens those benefits.Dartmouth is home to more than 900 international students, 200 faculty and staff, the college said.Fifteen Dartmouth students, scholars and staff are nationals of Iran or Iraq, two of the seven Muslim-majority countries targeted in Trumpâ€™s order.Thielman said that his organization will continue to resettle refugees. But he noted that a judge did not block Trumpâ€™s decision to cut the number of refugee resettlements from President Obamaâ€™s goal of 110,000 to 50,000.â€œBecause of President Trumpâ€™s order, we are expecting fewer refugees in the coming months,â€ù Thielman said.For the 12-month period that started Oct. 1, the State Department approved 240 refugees for Manchester and Nashua. So far, 101 have been resettled in Manchester; 19 in Nashua.",Immigration order continues to rile in NH,http://Unionleader.com/politics/Immigration-order-continues-to-rile-in-NH,http://Unionleader.com/politics/Immigration-order-continues-to-rile-in-NH2017-02-16T16:08:08.947683,11.02%,51%,"""Earlier today I spoke briefly with the President about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community,"" Kalanick wrote in a memo to employees.The Taxi Workers Alliance in New York had gone on strike, refusing to pick up fares at the airport, to protest Trump's executive order on refugee resettlement and travel from seven predominantly Muslim nations.""The fact is that the impact of the executive order on Silicon Valley's employment of foreign-born engineers is just one of the elements in play here.Secondary StrategyIt's doubtful the letter tech leaders reportedly are signing would have any effect on the president's opinion or his executive order, suggested Charles Kind, principal analyst at Pund-IT.After Trump signed the immigration ban, it was not only foreigners attempting to reach the U.S. for the first time who were impacted.","You donÂ’t need an army of developers to create segmented & personalized email campaigns.

Sessions advocates both stronger immigration enforcement and admitting a smaller number of immigrants annually. But since then, they have watched Republicans with a more relaxed attitude toward immigration, such as labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder, get tapped for key jobs.There is a diversity of views among Trump appointees on trade, but those with the most trade-centric jobs in the incoming administration tend to reflect the president-elect's views. Commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, trade representative designate Robert Lighthizer and trade policy adviser Peter Navarro all take Trump's line on trade agreements and protecting American jobs.Retired Gen. John Kelly would have a big immigration-policy impact if confirmed as secretary of homeland security. Immigration control advocates like Kelly, but they preferred Kobach. Kobach could get another position, even within the Department of Homeland Security, but some worry he would find running for governor of Kansas more attractive than even a deputy secretary title.Kobach has advised Trump on immigration since the campaign. He met with the president-elect during the Cabinet sweepstakes and is believed to have been considered for homeland security. Conservative columnists Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter have pushed for him on immigration-policy grounds.But there was a backlash against the immigration law Kobach helped Republicans draft in Arizona, and some of its provisions have been struck down by the Supreme Court. He has also come under fire for his work with immigration control advocacy groups. Both of these things could complicate his confirmation in a 52-48 Republican Senate.Other immigration hawks have grabbed senior administration positions that are not subject to Senate confirmation. It was announced Thursday that the White House Domestic Policy Council will report to senior adviser Stephen Miller, a Sessions alumnus who shares the Alabama senator's views on immigration. Immigration is part of the council's portfolio.An immigration czar would also be outside of Senate confirmation. Conservatives rejected the czar concept when it was employed by President Obama, however, and could easily balk again.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a progressive darling, broke through nationally as a consumer protection czar in the Obama administration, for example.Despite the near-universal belief Trump will take a hard line on immigration once sworn in, with activists warning of mass deportations, immigration hawks are worried he won't make their issue a high enough priority.",Immigration hawks seek reinforcements in Trump administration,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/immigration-hawks-seek-reinforcements-in-trump-administration/article/2611064?custom_click=rss,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/immigration-hawks-seek-reinforcements-in-trump-administration/article/2611064?custom_click=rss2017-02-21T13:31:33.825000,11.18%,49%,"On his immigration stand, he acted on his second week in office, pushing forward on the immigration laws that haven't been enforced the last 20 to 30 years.Those who had lived under Sharia law never were allowed to protest.I believe there are 46 countries that have Sharia law in place.Most of the people in the United States aren't interested in living under Sharia law or any other provision of any other system but the one we have in place now.The reason Trump applied this executive order was to protect the American people from being harmed.","Letter (Photo: File)President Trump wasted little time going to work on issues he promised to address. On his immigration stand, he acted on his second week in office, pushing forward on the immigration laws that haven't been enforced the last 20 to 30 years. It's surprising that so many people oppose the rule of law in our country.The executive order on scrutinizing immigrants who arrive from known extreme Islamic terrorist countries for at least the next 90 days is not an extreme demand. Many of those protesting aren't even American citizens.Those who had lived under Sharia law never were allowed to protest. I believe there are 46 countries that have Sharia law in place. People from countries that live under communist and fascist control have limited controlled protest.The reason Trump applied this executive order was to protect the American people from being harmed.Protests have merit that bring forth points that would benefit all of our country. It's hard to understand those who object to the rule of law. Our country is based on the guidance of our Constitution and the laws that govern us. Those laws have applied to all immigrants.Most of the people in the United States aren't interested in living under Sharia law or any other provision of any other system but the one we have in place now. Those who are dissatisfied with these laws could leave freely at any time.Sen. Joseph McCarthy tried to drain the swamp in the 1950s in Washington, D.C., and Hollywood.

Phil Scott introduced legislation on Thursday, Feb 9, 2017, declaring that the state would not cooperate wih any registry of citizens based on personal factors including race, religion or immigration status. APRIL MCCULLUM/FREE PRESSMONTPELIER - A bill intended to counter what lawmakers and Republican Gov. Phil Scott have called unconstitutional overreach by the administration of President Donald Trump on immigration policy is moving quickly through the law-making process.State Sen. Dick Sears, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said his committee is working with lawyers to make sure the bill doesnâ€™t conflict with current state law. The full Senate could vote on the proposal by the end of the week.â€œRight now our main goal is to not have unintended consequences,â€ù said Sears, of Bennington.Identical bills in the House and Senate were introduced last week on the heels of Trumpâ€™s executive order barring refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries admittance into the U.S.The Vermont law would prevent state and local law enforcement officers from collecting personal information, including immigration status and bar the federal government from deputizing officers in the state. Democratic Attorney General T.J. Donovan, who helped craft the bill, described it as a â€œproactiveâ€ù step.RELATED:One of Trumpâ€™s executive orders threatens to stop the flow of federal grant money to jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law. The federal government in the past has made good on threats to withhold money to states for refusing to make changes, such as complying with the 21-year-old drinking age, Sears said.â€œThat would be a big concern,â€ù he said.The bill has support from Democrats, Republicans and members of the stateâ€™s Progressive Party, but some House Republicans remain apprehensive.The bill will likely be out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by Thursday and then go to a floor vote, Sears said. It would then be considered by the House.If enacted, the law would go into effect July 1.RELATED:Read or Share this story: http://bfpne.ws/2lNqR2D",Bill challenging Trump immigration orders moves fast,http://Burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/bill-challenging-trump-immigration-orders-moves-fast/97919190/,http://Burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/bill-challenging-trump-immigration-orders-moves-fast/97919190/2017-01-09T18:31:21.644946,12.13%,47%,"The letter, which you can read in full below, alleges Trump accepted donations from unregistered political groups and that individual donations exceeded legal limits.The FEC is giving Trump's campaign until December 27 to respond to the letter or face an audit or enforcement action."" The letter goes on to name hundreds of individual contributors whose donations exceeded federal limits, including their names and donation amounts.A letter from the Federal Election Commission to Donald Trump's presidential campaign cited over 1,000 donations that may have violated various campaign finance laws , totaling around $1.3 million in campaign funds.According to CNN, these letters aren't uncommon, and Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders both received similar notices in the past.","According to CNN, these letters aren't uncommon, and Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders both received similar notices in the past.A letter from the Federal Election Commission to Donald Trump's presidential campaign cited over 1,000 donations that may have violated various campaign finance laws , totaling around $1.3 million in campaign funds.

Grassley and Ernst are supportive of our new immigration bans. Jesus was not a refugee fleeing from his country. He was born to a Jewish couple raised as such, and taught and preached to Jewish people during his earthly life. He was here to reach the lost sheep of Israel and directed his followers/disciples to go only to the same. There were only a couple instances written of involving Gentile contact with Jesus in his life. It was after his death, demanded by Jewish leaders, and after his resurrection years later that Paul as directed by Jesus, himself to go into all the nation of Gentiles to spread the word.With that said, I support Donald Trumpâ€™s ban on immigration as an act of protection to our country, citizens and freedoms.

This is the first necessary step of protection for our citizens and country.Iâ€™m thankful an ocean separates us, or we would be as infiltrated as the European countries. The same protection is being implemented with a wall against Mexico. It does not indicate President Trump is against Mexican heritage people. Illegal immigrants must obey laws, as must we all, for order and security.There is a legal means of citizenship and our president has stated he will allow this but not illegally. The drug problem in our country has great infiltration from Mexico and will be initially addressed by this wall as well. Our president is demanding necessary action to protect and safeguard our nation. He is to be commended for his actions. He has great conviction and strength in acting so quickly in these matters.

What does Trump have up his sleeve now that the travel ban has been denied?Stephen Miller, Trumpâ€™s policy adviser, has informed Fox News that President Donald Trump is considering all options to force a travel ban against illegal immigrants, who may pose as a threat against the American people.On January 27, President Trump imposed a travel ban from seven hostile nations, but the federal appeals court denied the ban. When Trump attempted to have the appeal lifted, it remained unchanged.Miller told Fox News that they are searching for ways to ensure the safety of our American citizens.â€œWe are contemplating new and additional actions â€_ to ensure our immigration system is not vehicles for terrorists.â€ùMiller argued that the appeals court has overstepped their authority by going against the Presidentâ€™s plan to stop radical terrorists from easily entering the United States, but assures that Trump will find a way to prevail in his promise.Although the executive orders were said to be poorly vetted and rushed, Miller argued that congressional experts drafted them. Further, he revealed that lawyers and top federal officials reviewed the executive orders prior to them being released.â€œThe three judges made a broad, over-reaching statement. The presidentâ€™s powers here are beyond question. Something good is going to come out of this. The powers of the president will be confirmed.â€ùAccording to the Washington Post, President Trump will likely wait until the beginning of the week to take action. He also told reporters on Air Force One that sending the order to the Supreme Court is still a likely scenario. Although this isnâ€™t moving as quick as Trump planned, he does feel confident that something will prevail.â€œWe will win that battle. The unfortunate part is that it takes time statutorily, but we will win that battle. We also have a lot of other options, including just filing a brand-new order.â€ùSome new revisions he plans to make with his attempt to have the executive order passed is to create additional security measures. Officials from the Justice Department and White House have concluded that with certain provisions, the order would likely be passed.Fox News Insider reveals that 72 percent of the refugees admitted to our country after the travel ban was overruled were from the seven nations deemed most of a threat. Between February 3 and February 11, 1,049 refugees came from Syria, Iraqi, Somalia, Iran, and Sudan. During the time, no refugees came from Yemen or Libya.According to Politifact, prior to Trumpâ€™s executive order, only 40 percent of refugees came from the seven countries outlined in his ban. Following the release of the statistics, Trump tweeted, â€œOur legal system is broken!â€ùTeen Vogue clarifies some additional quotes from Miller during his interview with Fox News.â€œWe have equal branches of government in this country. The judiciary is not supreme. A district judge in Seattle cannot force the President of the United States to change their laws and our constitution because of their own personal views. The bottom line is the presidentâ€™s power in this area of represents the apex of executive authority.â€ùCurrently, Trump has multiple options. He can take the order to the Supreme Court to be overturned, or he can create an alternative order with a different plan to prevent terrorists from entering our country. President Trump was very satisfied with Millerâ€™s interview and later tweeted congratulations to him for his wonderful representation.Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows.

Puzder is CEO of CKE restaurants which owns the fast food chains Hardeeâ€™s and Carlâ€™s Jr. He has argued against raising the minimum wage.Perez is now running for Chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Perez championed Mr. Obamaâ€™s efforts to expand overtime pay to millions of Americans. A Texas judge blocked a Labor Department rule expanding overtime in November.

Asked if he meant a new executive order, he said: â€œIt very well could be. We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be.â€ùSpeaking onboard Air Force One on his way to Florida for the weekend, Trump said he could sign a fresh executive order as soon as Monday or Tuesday.

Trump could choose to sidestep this fight and concentrate on the legal proceedings over whether the travel ban is constitutional, which will continue in Robartâ€™s court over the next weeks.Separately, an unidentified judge on the ninth circuit on Friday requested that the court consider reconsidering the travel ban case â€œen bancâ€ù â€“ or by a full panel of 11 judges. The courtâ€™s 25 judges will vote on the issue after both sides file briefs, which are due on 16 February.Earlier, Trump had said he would make a fresh policy announcement next week in response to the ruling, but he gave few details about his next move in a tussle with the judiciary that has stymied one of his first and most controversial measures.â€œWeâ€™ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country,â€ù Trump told a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. â€œYouâ€™ll see something next week.â€ùTrump suffered a setback on Thursday when a US appeals court refused to reinstate the temporary travel ban. Trump responded swiftly on Twitter with a message in capitals that said: â€œSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!â€ùSpeaking at the White House, the president insisted: â€œWe are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we are going to be very successful with, it shouldnâ€™t take too much time ... Ultimately I have no doubt weâ€™ll win that particular case.â€ùHe added: â€œThere are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. We will continue to do things to make our country safe. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.â€ùTrumpâ€™s order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and barred all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were banned indefinitely. It triggered disarray at airports and widespread protests.Trumpâ€™s defeated election opponent, Hillary Clinton, also responded to the court ruling, with a tweet that read: â€œ3-0â€ù â€“ presumably a reference either to the three judgesâ€™ unanimous verdict or three consecutive rulings against the ban.Democrats welcomed the verdict as a triumph for Americaâ€™s democratic checks and balances. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic caucus, said: â€œThis is a major, major, major defeat for the administration. And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep.â€ùAddressing Trumpâ€™s angry tweet, Crowley said: â€œThe president needs to grow up.â€ùThe president seems likely to take the battle all the way to the supreme court but he is also fending off more than a dozen additional lawsuits now moving through the courts. Lawyers for the state of Virginia are mounting one of the challenges, arguing that the ban violates the constitution and results from â€œanimus toward Muslimsâ€ù.A timeline of Trumpâ€™s travel ban: what's happened, and what's next Read moreMichael Kelly, a spokesman for the Virginia attorney general, Mark Herring, said Fridayâ€™s hearing in a federal court posed the most significant state challenge yet to Trumpâ€™s order. In a statement, he said it â€œwill be the most in-depth examination of the merits of the arguments against the banâ€ù.The district court in Washington state â€“ the court where the temporary restraining order was issued â€“ will continue to consider the original complaint of irreparable harm brought by the attorney general. The process, which could take months, could result in a ruling â€œon the meritsâ€ù of the ban, which would involve a detailed legal evaluation of the constitutional and statutory arguments.Abe was the only world leader to meet Trump before his inauguration and is the second, after Theresa May, to do so since the president took office. The meeting was seen as an opportunity to shore up US-Japanese relations after Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a flagship trade deal created by Barack Obama.I grabbed him and hugged him because thatâ€™s the way we feel. We have a very good chemistry Trump on Shinzo AbeAbe said: â€œOn TPP, of course we are fully aware of President Trumpâ€™s decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and the United States, trade and investment as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship?â€ùThe prime minister said â€œa new framework for dialogueâ€ù was already being developed. â€œAnd I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue. Now, to make sure it is a free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance has not changed.â€ùBoth leaders were keen to stress their warm relationship. â€œI grabbed him and hugged him because thatâ€™s the way we feel,â€ù Trump said. â€œWe have a very good bond, a very good chemistry.â€ùMeeting in the Oval Office, Trump reportedly told the Japanese prime minister: â€œYou have a strong handshake.â€ùThen, at a press conference in the east room, Trump welcomed Abe to the â€œvery famous White Houseâ€ù. He promised joint co-operation, including â€œagainst the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priorityâ€ù, and on a free and fair trade relationship.Abe, on a charm offensive, refrained from criticising Trump over the TPP. He hailed the US as a â€œchampion of democracyâ€ù and Trump as â€œan excellent businessmanâ€ù who had learned political skills during last yearâ€™s election campaign.Although he nodded along and seemed to be listening intently, Trump was not wearing a translation earpiece during Abeâ€™s remarks. Asked if Trump had worn an earpiece, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House deputy press secretary, said: â€œI donâ€™t believe during that time. But he did see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks.â€ù Trump did put a small speaker to his right ear during the question and answer session.Golf diplomacy: Japan's Abe hopes for strokes of genius to seal Trump trade pact Read moreOn Saturday, Trump will host Abe and his wife at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. The two leaders are scheduled to play golf on Saturday. A White House official said Trump was paying for Abe and his wife to travel to Mar-a-Lago as a â€œgiftâ€ù â€“ sidestepping ethical concerns that his properties might profit from a foreign visitor.Abe said modestly: â€œMy score in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all.â€ùAt the press conference, Trump took only two questions from western media outlets: the New York Post and Fox Business Network, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has been supportive of his campaign and administration. There was no opportunity during the short question-and-answer session for reporters from other organisations to ask about the controversies swirling around Trumpâ€™s aides Kellyanne Conway and Michael Flynn.While Conway, who is counsellor to the president, was rebuked by the White House on Thursday after she appeared on television urging the public to buy the branded products of the presidentâ€™s daughter Ivanka, the allegations against Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, are potentially far more serious. Reports claim that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before taking office, contrary to his earlier adamant denials.The report in the Washington Post contradicted Flynnâ€™s assertion on Wednesday that he never discussed the topic with Sergey Kislyak during a series of phone calls in December, while Obama was still president.On Friday, Flynnâ€™s staff at the national security council said he could no longer be sure whether sanctions had been discussed.Democrat Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said: â€œThe allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russiaâ€™s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trumpâ€™s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office.â€œIf he did so, and then he and other administration officials misled the American people, his conduct would be all the more pernicious, and he should no longer serve in this administration or any other.â€ùLate on Thursday, Trump reaffirmed Washingtonâ€™s longstanding â€œone Chinaâ€ù policy in a call with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The move looked set to ease tensions with China after earlier concerns that Trump might use Taiwan â€“ a democratically ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province â€“ as leverage in negotiations over trade, security and other issues.At his White House press conference, Trump said of the call with Xi: â€œIt was a very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. That will also be of benefit to Japan. We discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk.â€ùThe presidentâ€™s cabinet picks also continue to face resistance. Protesters blocked the new education secretary, Betsy DeVos, when she tried to enter a school in Washington on Friday morning. One demonstrator stood in front of the stairway entrance, prompting DeVos to walk back to her vehicle, though she eventually entered the building.The Senate voted along party lines early on Friday to confirm Tom Price, a conservative Georgia congressman and harsh critic of Obamaâ€™s healthcare reform, as health secretary. Trump had vowed to repeal and replace â€œObamacareâ€ù immediately but has since conceded that the process is complicated and may take time.The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut, speaking at a Washington Post forum, said that on inauguration day, he felt the odds were 80-20 that the Affordable Care Act would get repealed. â€œNow Iâ€™m not sure itâ€™s even 50-50.â€ù Democrats were willing to work with Republicans on various fixes and improvements, he added.Additional reporting by Julia Carrie Wong",Donald Trump considering 'brand new' immigration order,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/trump-travel-ban-new-policy-japan-shinzo-abe,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/10/trump-travel-ban-new-policy-japan-shinzo-abe2017-02-13T07:52:22.256241,17.71%,47%,"Donald Trump has said he is considering signing a â€œbrand-newâ€ù executive order on immigration, following the court ruling blocking his travel ban on Thursday.He said the White House was also considering â€œa lot of other options, including just filing a brand new orderâ€ù.At his White House press conference, Trump said of the call with Xi: â€œIt was a very warm conversation.Asked if Trump had worn an earpiece, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House deputy press secretary, said: â€œI donâ€™t believe during that time.We have a very good chemistry Trump on Shinzo AbeAbe said: â€œOn TPP, of course we are fully aware of President Trumpâ€™s decision.","Donald Trump has said he is considering signing a â€œbrand-newâ€ù executive order on immigration, following the court ruling blocking his travel ban on Thursday.The US president said he was confident he would win the court battle over the hugely controversial executive order suspending the countryâ€™s refugee programme and barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and which is currently blocked.He said the White House was also considering â€œa lot of other options, including just filing a brand new orderâ€ù.

Asked if he meant a new executive order, he said: â€œIt very well could be. We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be.â€ùSpeaking onboard Air Force One on his way to Florida for the weekend, Trump said he could sign a fresh executive order as soon as Monday or Tuesday. Asked what revisions the new order would include, he said: â€œNew security measures.â€ùHe said a new order would probably change â€œvery littleâ€ù from the first, according to the Associated Press.There was confusion about whether the administration intended to take the fight to the supreme court, following his setback in a San Francisco federal court on Thursday.Despite the president claiming he would â€œwin that [legal] battleâ€ù over the travel ban, a White House official told Reuters the president had decided not to go to the supreme court.â€œThe temporary restraining order, we would not take to the supreme court, but we are reviewing all options in the court system,â€ù the official was quoted as saying.Minutes later the Washington Post quoted White House chief of staff Reince Priebus as saying the administration was â€œreviewing all of our options in the court systemâ€ù â€“ including the supreme court.The ruling by the ninth US circuit court of appeals in San Francisco on Thursday applies only to the question of whether district judge James Robart in Seattle was correct in issuing a temporary restraining order against the travel ban. Trump could choose to sidestep this fight and concentrate on the legal proceedings over whether the travel ban is constitutional, which will continue in Robartâ€™s court over the next weeks.Separately, an unidentified judge on the ninth circuit on Friday requested that the court consider reconsidering the travel ban case â€œen bancâ€ù â€“ or by a full panel of 11 judges. The courtâ€™s 25 judges will vote on the issue after both sides file briefs, which are due on 16 February.Earlier, Trump had said he would make a fresh policy announcement next week in response to the ruling, but he gave few details about his next move in a tussle with the judiciary that has stymied one of his first and most controversial measures.â€œWeâ€™ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country,â€ù Trump told a joint press conference with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. â€œYouâ€™ll see something next week.â€ùTrump suffered a setback on Thursday when a US appeals court refused to reinstate the temporary travel ban. Trump responded swiftly on Twitter with a message in capitals that said: â€œSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!â€ùSpeaking at the White House, the president insisted: â€œWe are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we are going to be very successful with, it shouldnâ€™t take too much time ... Ultimately I have no doubt weâ€™ll win that particular case.â€ùHe added: â€œThere are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. We will continue to do things to make our country safe. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.â€ùTrumpâ€™s order barred people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days and barred all refugees for 120 days. Refugees from Syria were banned indefinitely. It triggered disarray at airports and widespread protests.Trumpâ€™s defeated election opponent, Hillary Clinton, also responded to the court ruling, with a tweet that read: â€œ3-0â€ù â€“ presumably a reference either to the three judgesâ€™ unanimous verdict or three consecutive rulings against the ban.Democrats welcomed the verdict as a triumph for Americaâ€™s democratic checks and balances. Joe Crowley, leader of the House Democratic caucus, said: â€œThis is a major, major, major defeat for the administration. And I think there will be more, because they will continue to overstep.â€ùAddressing Trumpâ€™s angry tweet, Crowley said: â€œThe president needs to grow up.â€ùThe president seems likely to take the battle all the way to the supreme court but he is also fending off more than a dozen additional lawsuits now moving through the courts. Lawyers for the state of Virginia are mounting one of the challenges, arguing that the ban violates the constitution and results from â€œanimus toward Muslimsâ€ù.A timeline of Trumpâ€™s travel ban: what's happened, and what's next Read moreMichael Kelly, a spokesman for the Virginia attorney general, Mark Herring, said Fridayâ€™s hearing in a federal court posed the most significant state challenge yet to Trumpâ€™s order. In a statement, he said it â€œwill be the most in-depth examination of the merits of the arguments against the banâ€ù.The district court in Washington state â€“ the court where the temporary restraining order was issued â€“ will continue to consider the original complaint of irreparable harm brought by the attorney general. The process, which could take months, could result in a ruling â€œon the meritsâ€ù of the ban, which would involve a detailed legal evaluation of the constitutional and statutory arguments.Abe was the only world leader to meet Trump before his inauguration and is the second, after Theresa May, to do so since the president took office. The meeting was seen as an opportunity to shore up US-Japanese relations after Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a flagship trade deal created by Barack Obama.I grabbed him and hugged him because thatâ€™s the way we feel. We have a very good chemistry Trump on Shinzo AbeAbe said: â€œOn TPP, of course we are fully aware of President Trumpâ€™s decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and the United States, trade and investment as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship?â€ùThe prime minister said â€œa new framework for dialogueâ€ù was already being developed. â€œAnd I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue. Now, to make sure it is a free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance has not changed.â€ùBoth leaders were keen to stress their warm relationship. â€œI grabbed him and hugged him because thatâ€™s the way we feel,â€ù Trump said. â€œWe have a very good bond, a very good chemistry.â€ùMeeting in the Oval Office, Trump reportedly told the Japanese prime minister: â€œYou have a strong handshake.â€ùThen, at a press conference in the east room, Trump welcomed Abe to the â€œvery famous White Houseâ€ù. He promised joint co-operation, including â€œagainst the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priorityâ€ù, and on a free and fair trade relationship.Abe, on a charm offensive, refrained from criticising Trump over the TPP. He hailed the US as a â€œchampion of democracyâ€ù and Trump as â€œan excellent businessmanâ€ù who had learned political skills during last yearâ€™s election campaign.Although he nodded along and seemed to be listening intently, Trump was not wearing a translation earpiece during Abeâ€™s remarks. Asked if Trump had worn an earpiece, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House deputy press secretary, said: â€œI donâ€™t believe during that time. But he did see the text and they spoke quite extensively before the remarks.â€ù Trump did put a small speaker to his right ear during the question and answer session.Golf diplomacy: Japan's Abe hopes for strokes of genius to seal Trump trade pact Read moreOn Saturday, Trump will host Abe and his wife at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. The two leaders are scheduled to play golf on Saturday. A White House official said Trump was paying for Abe and his wife to travel to Mar-a-Lago as a â€œgiftâ€ù â€“ sidestepping ethical concerns that his properties might profit from a foreign visitor.Abe said modestly: â€œMy score in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all.â€ùAt the press conference, Trump took only two questions from western media outlets: the New York Post and Fox Business Network, both owned by Rupert Murdoch, who has been supportive of his campaign and administration. There was no opportunity during the short question-and-answer session for reporters from other organisations to ask about the controversies swirling around Trumpâ€™s aides Kellyanne Conway and Michael Flynn.While Conway, who is counsellor to the president, was rebuked by the White House on Thursday after she appeared on television urging the public to buy the branded products of the presidentâ€™s daughter Ivanka, the allegations against Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, are potentially far more serious. Reports claim that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador to Washington before taking office, contrary to his earlier adamant denials.The report in the Washington Post contradicted Flynnâ€™s assertion on Wednesday that he never discussed the topic with Sergey Kislyak during a series of phone calls in December, while Obama was still president.On Friday, Flynnâ€™s staff at the national security council said he could no longer be sure whether sanctions had been discussed.Democrat Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House permanent select committee on intelligence, said: â€œThe allegation that General Flynn, while President Obama was still in office, secretly discussed with Russiaâ€™s ambassador ways to undermine the sanctions levied against Russia for its interference in the Presidential election on Donald Trumpâ€™s behalf, raises serious questions of legality and fitness for office.â€œIf he did so, and then he and other administration officials misled the American people, his conduct would be all the more pernicious, and he should no longer serve in this administration or any other.â€ùLate on Thursday, Trump reaffirmed Washingtonâ€™s longstanding â€œone Chinaâ€ù policy in a call with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The move looked set to ease tensions with China after earlier concerns that Trump might use Taiwan â€“ a democratically ruled island that Beijing considers a breakaway province â€“ as leverage in negotiations over trade, security and other issues.At his White House press conference, Trump said of the call with Xi: â€œIt was a very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. That will also be of benefit to Japan. We discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk.â€ùThe presidentâ€™s cabinet picks also continue to face resistance.

About 700,000 undocumented immigrants came to the U.S. as children and are now protected by a deferred action program set up by President Barack Obama, according to CNN.Another 4-5 million were eligible for protection under a similar program for parents of U.S. citizens that was blocked by federal courts.Trump has indicated recently he might not take quite as strong a stand on at least some issues involving immigration, the cable news network reported.""We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud,"" Trump said of those brought to the U.S. as children, who meet certain education and work requirements.""They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here.

Almost 33% of almost each and every business done in the nation is carried-out in Budapest. Given this--in case you are eager to launch a company in Hungary--you will not get a better option that the capital.Now letâ€™s take a swift look at the cost of doing business in Hungary under these heads!Tax BenefitsAt only 10%, the nation has possibly the least corporate tax rate across the whole Europe, and this makes it pretty sensible to shift proceeds to the many Hungarian subsidiaries.Trained, Committed IndividualsIts qualified, creative manpower is accessible for just 33% of the cost of their Western European matching parts. The administrationâ€™s attempts to boost employment have formed a rather supportive atmosphere for recruiters, with noninterventionist employment rules &regulations. Robust employer rights make it quite simple to use only those one requires. Against this backdrop, the labour market conditions of Hungary are appreciably more flexible and fairly priced, in relation to those in Western Europe.Not Too High CostsThe prices of real estate have nose-dived by close-to 30% since 2008 even as the costs of business services are incredibly low, vis-Ã -vis Western Europe.The overall cost of doing business in Hungary is not too high even
