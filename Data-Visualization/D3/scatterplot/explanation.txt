Q3 A.2

We have to use "BMI vs. Blood Pressure" feature combination than "Plasma Glucose vs.Insulin" to separate the "negative" class and "positive" class from the classes.
Because we can see the scatterplots of two classes clearly in the first feature combination.

Q3 C
We need to use "square root scale" method when we are going to see the scatterplots that Y value isn't 0 more clearly.
We need to use "log scale" method when we are going to see the scatterplots that Y value is 0 and Y value isn't 0 separately.
