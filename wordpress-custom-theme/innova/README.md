## What's included?

Workflow is currently based on [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com). Structure of files is based on mobile-first coding. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) is created using [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) ideology. Repository is fully automated by [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) tasks. Workflow includes [Bower](https://bower.io), so you can very easy include new plugins - thanks to Gulp all of JS and CSS files of Bower plugins are automatically included into main scripts and styles files.
