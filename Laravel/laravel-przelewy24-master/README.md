### Usage

In order to use the system, you need to do a few things:

1. You need to launch the registration request in order to init payment

2. You need to handle customer returning routes to your app. By default there are routes 'transfers24/callback'

3. You should ensure transaction verify. Here you should send verify request of payment after receiving notification about correct transaction from payment system. You need to handle returning routes to status  of  the  transaction which is  sent automatically from payment system. By default there are routes 'transfers24/status'

#### Registration request

This is main request you need to launch to init payment. 
        
The most basic sample code for authorization request could look like this:

```php      
$payment = app()->make(\App\Payment::class);
$registration_request = app()->make(\Devpark\Transfers24\Requests\Transfers24::class);

$register_payment = $registration_request->setEmail('test@example.com')->setAmount(100)->setArticle('Article Name')->init();

if($register_payment->isSuccess())
{
    // save registration parameters in payment object
    
    return $registration_request->execute($register_payment->getToken(), true);
}
```            
This code should be run in controller as it's returning response which will takes few things.

1. Status registration payment

2. Token, if registration done with success

3. Error code return from payment system

4. Error Message return from payment system

5. Request parameters send to payment system


For `setAmount` default currency is PLN. If you want to use other currency, you should use currency constant from `\Devpark\Transfers24\Currency` class as 2nd parameter. Also please notice that amount you should give to this function is real amount (with decimal places) and not converted already to Przelewy24 format.
  
For `\Devpark\Transfers24\Requests\Transfers24::execute` method 2nd parameter decides of redirection to payment system when true or return url for making payment when false

#### Define customer returning routes

You should create routes that will redirect customer after the completed transaction (those routes will be launched using `GET` HTTP method), 

#### Handling transaction verify route

To make sure the payment was really successful you should use `\Devpark\Transfers24\Requests\Transfers24::receive` method. The simplest code could look like this:

```php
$payment_verify = app()->make(\Devpark\Transfers24\Requests\Transfers24::class);
$payment_response = $payment_verify->receive($request);

if ($payment_response->isSuccess()) {
    $payment = Payment::where('session_id',$payment_response->getSessionId())->firstOrFail();
   // process order here after making sure it was real payment
}
echo "OK";
```

This code should be run in controller, because you should return non-empty response when receiving valid przelewy24 request for transaction verify. As you see, you should make sure it was real payment before you process the order and then you need to make sure that it was successful. You can identify payment via session_id (unique ID generate during registration of payment)).
